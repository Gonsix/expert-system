Subject: Enron Data Responses for FERC's Bulk Power Investigation

Attached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services' 
responses to the Staff's data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's Bulk Power Investigation.  These responses assumes that you sent 
separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that 
information.  The answers also assume you are requesting this information for 
California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.  Please let me know 
if these assumptions are incorrect.  

If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact 
Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.  Enron requests confidential 
treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 
388.112.  Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable 
to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in 
question 4.  We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday.  
Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862.  I will be traveling on 
Monday, so if you call then, call my cell phone at 503 807-0929.

chris.stokley@enron.com,"ACCOMPLISHMENTS

?	Successfully hired trained and implemted a group within VM that acts as the liaison b/w Houston Settlements and our Traders.
?	Provided guidance to Virginia on what type of reports would be needed for the Traders along w/ settling up a weekly forum by which she can communicate her issues and results to the traders.
?	Helped coordinate a plan of attack on how we would become current on ISO actualizations and on what we would do in the interim.
?	Provide leadership,guicance and a shoulder for the group to cry on during a very stressful six months.
?	Worked Murray O'neil to provide different reporting units with timely accurate reporting of EPMI's credit position w/ the ISO and PX.
?	Provided solutions that helped manage Mid-Marketing expectations with what the group could provide in a timely manner due to our technology constraints.
?	Made communication and transfer of knowledge a top priority within the group, which is now paying off dividends. Quite a few members of the group now are able to interchange duties when necessary and therefore able to dilute the stress level of the person that is becoming overwhelmed.
?	Came up with the calculation that has the potential to add money to the desk under the current  ISO inc dec pricing.





GOALS
	
?	To gain more working knowledge of the financial products used by the Commercial units of Enron
?	Successfully complete the EES project by year-end and make a transition to a new rotation.
?	Continue to increase my knowledge of relevant software ( VB, Excel, Access, etc.)
?	Take courses on financial modeling and statistical analysis
?	Take my knowledge of the both the ENA process and the West market, and transfer them over to the EES business unit.
?	Gain intimate knowledge of all of the relevant reports and reporting tools that are used within Enron.
?	Formulate a clear plan by year-end  to where I want to be in the next two years, and what I need to do to arrive at my end goal.

How is everything going in the wonderful PacifiCorp world? Did you ever settle into a specific job or do still move around. Risk group seems to be doing better, they even get to get off early one day a week. I am pretty much spending all of my time in Houston working on the EES project, kinda sucks s far as the travel goes. I don't know if you heard, but we lost Sean could lose more at year end when all of the contracts come to duration.

Gentlemen,

I have been pulled into an emergency task force this morning by Evan Hughes to address some CA issues for which you are probably aware.  Therefore, I must reschedule our meeting for tomorrow afternoon or Friday.  I would like to try 3:00pm on Thurs.  What are your schedules looking like?"

chris.stokley@enron.com,"That is ok with me 

 "
chris.stokley@enron.com,"Keoni,

	I realize that there are no penalty charges associated to Load, I am referring to the neg. and positive load deviation. What are all of the charges associated to the penalties for deviation from schedule. 

	Ps  Jim, take your best cut at what you think these charges are and then get Keoni too sign off on what results you come up with. We need to put every charge that we think is linked to a schedule and then just have Keoni fill in the gaps and sign off on the document.

	Questions:
1)	What DA and RT Excel reports are you referencing in the e-mail below? The only report that my group currently sends out is the ISO HA Final which comes from Jim Reyes. 
2)	Who are the contacts that are sending you these reports and what are the timelines in which you receive these reports after the date of physical flow.
3)	Please send me and example of both the reports and the discrepancies that you have encountered along w/ your process for booking the information given in the reports.

I think that you are probably referring to the reports that Kate Symes and the R-T group send out, but I don't want to jump to that conclusion without you confirming that to be true. Any information you can give me on the process will be helpful in coming up w/ a solution to the issues that you are running into.

	What do think of the latest re-org and the e-mail we got from Derenda. Do you have any insight into what is going on over in the EES world. It looks like I will be on the team that helps sort all of this out and I wanted to see if you had any knowledge on Don Black. Also, who is the gentleman that caused you and Derenda so much grief? I guess this all worked out well for you in the end, since you won't have to sweat all of the decisions that are about to take place for that area of the business. I more than likely will be in Houston quite a bit over the next 6mts, so I will swing by and visit with you and Chad when I find out my schedule. Hope all is going well, Derenda told me that you were enjoying your job.

Tim wants Don Black to stay in place for the short term to help him make his way through this mess called EES. Don Black has not been with EES that long, so he is not being hit w/ any of the blame for the current problems. I should have a clearer picture of what is going on in the next couple of weeks.

Why did you not convey this change in status to Murray or myself? And who gave you the direction to put everything on hold until Murray and Kevin spoke? Murray knows nothing about this conversation that is supposed to take place with Kevin Hughes. Let me make this as clear as possible, EPMI is the one that is driving this process and you where given your direction by me to proceed forward on this audit.

	I am a little confused, my understanding was that you would be able to escalate these items to get a quick turnaround time in comparison to going the normal process. What you are recommending sounds like the normal process, am I incorrect on that conclusion?  When can I expect to get feedback from CSC with the process listed below? 


								Chris
 "
chris.stokley@enron.com,"Pamela,
	Where do you get the numbers for the EEMC tab? Here are the stages of the process that I currently know about:
	
		1) EES sends the schedule  file to the EPMI server
		2) Calf. schedulers pull EES schedules into their portfolio and submit the information to the ISO.
		3) ISO sends back Day Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES original schedule)
		4) ISO Sends back Hour Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES schedule from the Day Ahead Market)

	As you can see, there is quite a few places that changes can occur to an EES schedule in the course of a day. So I am trying to follow the information flow on both the EES side and the EPMI side. If the only schedule you see is the one that is originally sent to the  EPMI server, then I can see where we have the potential to have many unexplained variances. If this is the case, this may be nothing more than providing you with the incremental information that is provided by the ISO during the course of a given day. Just update me on your process flow, and I will keep this issue moving along until completion.

								Thanks
								  Chris

Chris,  the spreadsheet below contains the HA_Finals that you send to me(EPMI) as well as the scheduled volumes sent from the scheduling group(EES).  The volumes on the EPMI tab is inconsistent with the EEMC tab.  Please review the variance sheet tab which will denote the days, zone and hours where the difference occur.    I am assuming the EPMI numbers are incorrect because of the hour by hour consistency on the EEMC  spreadsheet.  However,  this assumption could be incorrect.   Again, please review and let me know. 

Thanks,

<Embedded StdOleLink>"
chris.stokley@enron.com,"Pamela,
	I understand that you are getting your information from the schedulers, my question is at what point in the process. Is this the info that is originally sent to the server with no updates? If so, then we are going to keep having variances until we get you more up to date information. I know that the Calf. schedulers send a new file to EES after the close of the Day Ahead Mrkt, yet I don't see these updated numbers reflected in the schedules that you sent me. Find out from your schedulers if this is the original schedule that is sent to us on the server, and if so, are they updating the file after the changes in the Day-Ahead Mrkt. I want to make sure that you and I are chasing true variances and not timing variances.

	I finally grew some balls and had my meeting with Murray. It went really well, a lot different than I expected. I now have to meet w/ Tim so that he can lay out what opportunities he thinks exist on the floor. That should be interesting. I will get in early tomorrow, and give you a call to give you an update. I have not sent my accomplishments b/c I wanted to hear what Tim had to say as far as opportunities on the floor. The last thing I want to do is have Paul take the time to go pass around my resume and me not follow through on those potential offers. Talk to you tommorow.

Subject:	RE: Publications

Good morning, Chris.

I apologize for not replying to you on Friday; I have been out of the office until today.

The problem with the Publications container is a Yahoo issue, as they are the backbone to the portal.  I have spoken with our Portal administrator, and he is working to fix the problem with Yahoo.  As soon as it is back up and running, you will be one of the first to know.

Thank you for your patience,
Elizabeth

Brett,  In talking to Chris Stokley yesterday, he said to draw the amount for
the above subject invoice from your collateral account.  He was going to Email
me a memo stating this.   To date, I have not received that Email.  Since you
Emailed me the information for last billing cycle, can you furnish me this info
for the above invoice?   Would like it in writing before we apply the credit.

Thanks,  Don



"
chris.stokley@enron.com,"I will look into what timeline that we can get these guys paid on and talk with you today. As far as the other issue, we are no where close to being able to take that project on. The current new hires are just to get us caught up in the short term. After that, then it may be a do able item, but right now all I want the new guys concentrating on is getting us caught up. I see this hand-off taking place sometime in the 3rd qtr of this year, when we get the rest of our staff in place.

Subject:	Willamette

Chris,

I just received a call from Willamette Ind. concerning our future business. It seems Aquila is making a proposal for Willamette's business. 
Willamette is reasonably satisfied with their Enron relationship with the exception of the time it takes for Enron to settle California business.  They mentioned that timely settlement of the outstanding balances for November and December would be helpful in discussions with their upper management.

I'm confident that Enron will retain Willamette's business, but it would be extremely helpful if we can get them paid for CISO business for November and December before the end of April. 

Let me know what Volume Management needs from Services to get Willamette paid for Nov. and Dec.

On another topic, with your new hires coming soon can we shift the settlements for Services Customers, like we've discussed, to Volume Management?


Regards,


Les Rawson

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

	I apologize for  not doing a better job of staying in touch the past few months. I have been flying into Houston every week for the past two months, which is getting quite old. I am not sure what will come of this project, but so far I am still dealing w/ Settlement issues. I hear that things are going a lot better for you since we last spoke, promotion, your own book, etc. Monica seems to also be doing quite well in her new role in origination. She did have time to give me shit for not doing a better job of staying in touch. I told her to go slap you in the head and make you install Instant Messenger on your Computer, so please do so. It is about the only way that I get a chance to communicate  w/ anyone these days including my family.

 "
chris.stokley@enron.com,"Brenda,
Here are the events as I know them
1)	On 7/25/01 this item was brought to the attention of varies members of a team meeting for Project Ranger. At that point, it was  agreed that this item should be high priority and Robert Bailey offered to push it forward.
2)	On Friday(7/27/01) I got a call from John Rutledge asking if he is the person that is supposed to enter  the WIP to CSC. John had never had any dealing w/ filling out a WIP, plus he is unsure if he is the person to fill it out. (Ball drop number one)
3)	WIP is finally submitted on 7/30/01. I got a call from Jacqueline Johnson on 8/2/01 asking a bunch of questions about the work request that was submitted by John. At that point I ask why I am just now being contacted if the WIP was submitted on Monday(7/30/01). Jacqueline then goes on to tell me that she has not been in the office that week and is just now getting around to reviewing our WIP request. I then ask why she did not have a backup covering her during her absence and told her she needs to get this out the door ASAP. (Ball drop number two)
4)	Brenda sends out an e-mail on Friday asking for an update from Richard Miller on the CSC issue. Yesterday at about 11:30 I sent an e-mail to Richard asking for an up date on the e-mail that Brenda sent out. I then get a call from Richard and Steve Walker in which they both told me that this item is not showing as an emergency item to CSC. Both told me that it was never conveyed to them that this was an emergency item, but  they will now escalated it to such. (Ball drop number three)

In summary, John should have been given a lot more guidance in filling the WIP out and getting it submitted to CSC since he has no prior relationship with CSC. As far as the rest of the items listed, I am unsure of where the disconnect in communication occurred at this time. Lastly, where does Robert Gresch fit in all of this since he is the one that I conveyed my concern about this item not looking like it was escalated to emergency status(7/26/01)? 




							Chris Stokley
 "
chris.stokley@enron.com,"

 "
chris.stokley@enron.com,"Yes, but sadly know one took the initiative to follow through on this item. I had to call today and get the ball rolling because it was never moved to emergency status. 



								Chris

 "
chris.stokley@enron.com,"Richard,
	This is the last e-mail that I got from Mr. Gresch. As you can see, I am asking if this has been escalated to something other than the normal process. From the conversation we just had, I guess the level of priority never made it's way to you. While I am not sure who dropped the ball on this item, the fact remains that it was dropped and another week of information that is crucial to the intramonth book was missed. From this point forward, I would like to know who I should be talking with when it comes to these types of issues so as to avoid this miscommunication in the future.

	You should have notified me that you had passed this off to Maurice and not acted on it since we talked last Wed. From here on out I will assume that Maurice is the key person to get these issues resolved. Based on the e-mail below, I lost one week by your not having this conversation w/ a CSC rep last week. This is a week that we could not afford to lose. 

Maurice,
	Let me know what we need on our side to get the MDMA process escalated to a high priority item. Also, what is the estimated time of delivery from CSC once we make this a priority?  I agree w/ you best scenario recommendation, I would just like to be able to compare delivery dates b/w the two process that you have laid out. Thanks for your help on these items.

			Ps. When next week can we expect CSC to deliver these accounts to the FTP server? Also, what time the next day can we pull the files off 
			      Of the server?

	I apologize for not getting back w/ you in a more timely manner. As far as tracking a deal through the system, we have made very little progress. I have been pulled off on a couple of other projects that were deemed to be of higher priority. I talked to Chris Leonard last week to see if he could be of some help in tracking this down for us since he knows the Risk systems very well.

	I am more than happy to get this issue resolved, however, this is the first that I have heard about getting a number to the customer by EOB 9/28/01.Here are some of the questions that I have regarding this deal:
						1) What index are we settling this contract at. I see that you have both a 10-min Dec price along with an hourly price in the spreadsheet that you sent me. My 
						     is that it would be settled at the Dec since that is what the ISO pays at, but I need confirmation that the customer has agreed to this index.
						2) Are the prices you have in your spreadsheet settlement quality since the ISO does not publish any changes to their web site that happen after 96hrs.
						3) What method are we using to confirm the customers usage other than him sending us a file.
						4) When can we expect to get the usage data for Feb.-July
						5) Are these spreadsheets the detail behind what was invoiced to the customer.
						6) Do you have a copy of the latest contract with this customer that gives the calculation language appropriate to their over-generation.
 
   I will get this turned around for you as soon a possible once we get the details ironed out on the process. I understand your urgency in wanting to get this settled as soon as possible and I will make sure that happens going forward. However, I will need your patience on getting this settled for Aug. since I have yet to find a documented process for the proper settlement of this contract. Please free to give me a call if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

Here are some questions and answers that you will find helpful:
*	Are self provided ancillary services (on a SC required basis)
sequential; excess spin rolls into nonspin requirement for the SC (if
offered
as nonspin).

 NO, If an SC self provides 130 MW of SPIN capacity yet the calculated
market requirement is only 100MW,  the self-provided amount of 120 MW will
be accepted for SPIN and none of the EXCESS 30 MW of capacity considered for
other A/S services.

Please Note if in this example the SC's SPIN obligation is calculated to be
90 MW, the over self provided portion (100MW - 90MW) = 10 MW would receive a
payment.  In this example there is an additional 20 MW of EXCESS above the
total market requirement that ""gets left on the table"" which will receive no
compensation.


*	If self provision reserves are offered in excess of the total
quantity required for the total market, will the ISO take them all anyway or
will the offerings be truncated and perhaps roll into a subsequent service
(if offered as self provide in that service).

NO, As in the above answer.  The total Self provided quantity will be
accepted and there would be no reduction of the preferred schedule even if
this amount is ABOVE the total market requirement.

	Here is a first cut of some of the questions that  need to be answered by the generator that is offering this service. I will have more as I dig into the detail this    	week.

			1) Non performance by counterparty (don't deliver energy when called) :
                                                       - Who is going to be held financially responsible if the generator is unable to meet the ISO instructions to Inc or Dec gen? 
			2)  Is the generator located in the grid or out of the grid?
			        - This is important to know so that we can evaluate our control area risk.
                                                3)   Has the generator registered and been certified by the ISO to deliver all of the A/s Products(Regulation,Spin, Non-Spin and Replacement)
			        - Need to know the specific unit ID's of the performing units so that we can verify w/ the ISO.
                                                4)   Are we paying the Generator based on what we bid in to the ISO or on what the ISO actually grants to EPMI. 
			5)   Are we paying the Generator a fixed price on Capacity and Energy or just passing through what the ISO pays EPMI minus losses for energy.
			   




		Other risks that we need to take look at as EPMI
			1)   Will the revenue stream coming in from the A/S payments put EPMI at risk of becoming a Creditor to the ISO instead of a Debtor.
			2)   EPMI reputation w/ the ISO if the Generator has perpetual non-performance issues. This could impact all of our A/S business if the ISO feels 
			       that EPMI is not able to meet its A/S obligation to the ISO on a consistent basis.
			3)   Need to make sure that they have language in the contract that covers EPMI and EES if we loss a dispute to the ISO. 
                                                4)   Risk to EPMI if the generator fails to deliver energy and the ISO takes back all capacity payment back to the last time in which EPMI
			       performed on an energy call. I think this is based on the entire EPMI portfolio not just for a specific unit. I will need to check on this item
			        Monday.

Steve,
	I don't see the attachment. As far as the percentage of Calf. contracts that have  band consumption, my assumption is that it is quite high. I base this on our discussion w/ Dennis and my talks w/ Neil Bresnen. My understanding is that all contracts that where written after first quarter of 1999, have some type of  band consumption language in them.  I spoke w/ Joshua yesterday and I feel that we are making the progress that I would expect at this point. I would like to meet w/ you when I get back in Houston on Monday if you have the time. Also, Joshua is supposed to send me an update today so that I can better assess as to where we are at on the consumption band initiative.

			PS. Sorry I am late getting back w/ you, I could get into my e-mail yesterday but could not send out any e-mail. I still owe you the Project Phoenix   			       list. Also, do we still need to meet w/ Kristian and Murray?

	Just curious, who do you think has time to go over the mistakes that you may have made in these spreadsheets? For the time being, Pam will take care of this process for you. In return, you will be given a 24hr timeline to get all discrepancies answered and cleaned up in Deal Tracker. I feel this is a fair timeline since Pam is the person doing the leg work to identify all discrepancies. If you have any questions or suggestion on this process, feel free to call me at 56120.

 "

	I want to make it very clear that the questions I am having Pam ask are not meant to put anyone one on the defensive. From what I can tell so far, we have a process that is at best inefficient and at worst broken. Pam will be asking a lot of questions going forward because she does not know your process and she is on task to learn it. Please have patience and offer guidance on how we can get these issues resolved so we can better put to use everyone's time. We are all paid to fix problems, not point fingers. I have a lot of faith in the people in the Portland office, that is why I am asking Pam to go to you guys for guidance. If anyone has any issues going forward please feel free to contact me at 503-807-8959 or e-mail me.

	From the discussion that I just had with Pam, this does not seem to be clearly the case. She will do further research and see if there is an issue with Ibook, but you need to give some examples of how you came to such a clear conclusion.  This is something that should have been done some time ago. What I expect is that you and Pam will work together to come up with an efficient solution. It was also brought to my attention that you want to minimize the time you spend on this process, I would agree with that.

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments


It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.


Thanks,

Charlie

Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the 
petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged 
drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and 
possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these 
assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the 
estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other 
facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.

Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial 
complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to 
experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties 
identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado, 
Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine 
whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.

Here are the reviews of the UT Energy Finance program that  you requested:


From Jennifer Martinez  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of=20
1998):

The Energy Finance Program 2 years ago was very good, especially considerin=
g=20
it was the first year of the program.  There were a lot of guest speakers=
=20
from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge abou=
t=20
the energy industry through case studies, lectures, etc.  Basically, we=20
learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance=
=20
classes, but all the cases and examples were energy-related.  The professor=
s=20
were good for the most part but didn't have a great deal of practical=20
industry experience.  If I had to guess the reason for decreased=20
participation in the program, I would probably say it is the professors. =
=20
Ronn and Titman are great but known as being very technical and=20
quantitative.  Some students prefer less technical professors and classes=
=20
that aren't limiting to the energy industry.  Also, the fact that the class=
=20
meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing.  Other than those=
=20
things, I can't imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment.  I=20
especially don't understand why every single person didn't drop for Enron. =
 I=20
wonder if it has something to do with international status.???=20

It was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a=

Way to make Better:

From Ross Mesquita  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):

To be honest, a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific.  =
=20
When energy applications were presented, it seemed more like general financ=
e=20
questions were reworded to include energy lingo.  We had some very good=20
speakers, but for the most part, I did not feel like the 6 hours of class h=
ad=20
enough energy focus.  I assumed that this would get better as the program=
=20
progressed.

One reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that Energy=20
Finance is a very specific focus.  I would have probably not enrolled in th=
e=20
Energy Finance program had it been available in my first year.  I did not=
=20
know enough about energy at that time and I had returned to B-school to=20
consider several career options -- i.e., investment banking, corporate=20
finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, etc.  As a new MBA student, I would n=
ot=20
want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies. =20

Here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many MBAs--

My interest in Enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa. =
=20

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

----------

From Billy Braddock   (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998=
):

I was a participant in the inaugural Energy Finance program in the Fall of=
=20
1998.  The primary positives to the class revolved around outside=20
panels/instruction.  For example, Enron sent representatives on 2 separate=
=20
occasions to discuss particular topics (Vince Kaminski and Gary Hickerson).=
 =20
Other notable speakers were Jeff Sandefer (independent business consultant=
=20
and E&P professional), the Beacon Group, and Encap Investments.  Another go=
od=20
speaker was a professor from UT's school of engineering.  He brought a good=
=20
perspective as to the ""basics"" of the energy business.

The class was structured via a team-based instruction approach, with 3=20
professors team-teaching a 6-hour credit course.  None of the 3 professors=
=20
had any product knowledge of the energy business.  Of the 3 professors, 2=
=20
were research focussed/tenured with little credibility in ""teaching.""  One =
of=20
the professors primary focus of research was fixed income, while the other =
2=20
were investments and corporate finance, respectively. =20

As is the case for UT's finance program in general, and energy finance in=
=20
particular, UT is in dire need of teaching professors (as opposed to resear=
ch=20
professors) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples=
=20
and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a=
=20
finance background.  Particular to the energy program, UT needs to have mor=
e=20
instruction from energy professionals (such as the instructors used for=20
Enron's internal learning programs (ie. Derivatives classes, etc.).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

From Bryan Williams  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998)=
:

I participated in the first Energy Finance class offered in Fall of 1998, a=
t=20
the University of Texas. =20

The curriculum was understandably =01&rough around the edges=018 as 1998 wa=
s the=20
first year the Energy Finance course was offered.  However, the instruction=
=20
also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak=
=20
of (The 6-credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors).=
=20

Two of the three professors have co-authored textbooks, and the third=20
professor=01,s claim to fame is fixed income.  As a group, the three profes=
sors=20
are research-heavy (as opposed to industry focused), and the team-teaching=
=20
format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for=
=20
the success of the class. =20

That said, the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside=
=20
speakers.  Among them: Vince=20
Kaminski & Gary Hickerson, both of Enron.  They also dedicated one class=20
period to a video conference call with the Beacon Group, an energy consulti=
ng=20
group that I believe was recently acquired by Goldman.
Jeff Sandefer, an independent businessman, an entreprenuership instructor,=
=20
and one of the foremost experts in the E&P sector, also spoke to the class.=
 =20
Jeff was joined by some of the executives from Houston-based Encap.

The woes of the Energy Finance could be easily remedied by injecting some=
=20
instruction from someone from industry.    The class is too=20
academic/theoretical with too few relevant examples excerpted from the ener=
gy=20
sector.=20

The instructors Enron uses for the Derivatives courses taught internally ar=
e=20
good examples of people who can package very relevant information and=20

would bode well for the Energy Finance program at UT. =20

From Yuan Tian  (MBA class of 2000, Energy Finance taken fall of 1999):

Here are my thoughts on the UT Energy Finance Program:

exposed to different financial perspectives from the other industries;
- there are some experienced, brand-name professors (e.g. Sheridan Titman)=

teaching in the program;=20

Cons:
- the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies=

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
From George Huan  (MBA class of 2000, Energy Finance taken fall of 1999):

Companies expect MBA students to have both general management (new ideas) a=

analytic (quantative) skills.  Energy industry is no exception.

Energy Finance Program offers Financial Strategy and Risk Managements cours=
es=20
which fit in the insudtry need.  However, these two courses are far from=20
enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation=
=20
and excitements and opportunities in this industry.   Other management and=
=20
quantitive courses are needed to complete this program.=20
My suggestions:

1) Seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies. Before=
=20
students make their decisions, let them know:  What's happening and what's=
=20
going to happen in this industry;  What the companies are doing now;  Who=

From Charlie Weldon (MBA Class of 2000, Energy Finance taken in fall of 199=
9)

My experience in the Energy Finance program overall was a positive=20
experience.  The most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers=20
brought in during Dr. Titman's portion of the class.  This part of the cour=
se=20
is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~10 case=20
classes all focusing on the Energy industry.  Two of the cases were based o=
n=20
Enron, and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate an=
d=20
well thought out.  Value added by the professor was less than from the=20
speakers and cases.

The first eight  weeks of the course covered futures and options.  Nearly a=
ll=20
of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy=20
industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student's=20
understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market.  The u=
se=20
of options and futures for speculating and/or hedging was stressed on=20
numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power=
=20
plant project.

I believe that the University Energy Finance faculty are trying to=20
continuously make improvements to the program.  However, I do not believe=
=20
that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to=20
improvement.   There is a strong need for more practical based training on=
=20
energy derivatives similar to the course taught by Paradigm here at Enron. =
=20
The focus of the University teachers is quite theoretical, due in large par=
t=20
to their background.  While the theoretical basis is crucial to understandi=
ng=20
the basics, the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective=
=20
bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course. =20

Until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive=
=20
industry experience, I believe the Energy Finance program will continue to=
=20
underdeliver on its objectives.  Additionally, I believe that the course=20
structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive=

v.weldon@enron.com,"Folks,

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm

Please let me know if any further research is needed.

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm

Please let me know if any further research is needed.

Here are the reviews of the UT Energy Finance program that  you requested:


From Jennifer Martinez  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of=20
1998):

The Energy Finance Program 2 years ago was very good, especially considerin=
g=20
it was the first year of the program.  There were a lot of guest speakers=
=20
from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge abou=
t=20
the energy industry through case studies, lectures, etc.  Basically, we=20
learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance=
=20
classes, but all the cases and examples were energy-related.  The professor=
s=20
were good for the most part but didn't have a great deal of practical=20
industry experience.  If I had to guess the reason for decreased=20
participation in the program, I would probably say it is the professors. =
=20
Ronn and Titman are great but known as being very technical and=20
quantitative.  Some students prefer less technical professors and classes=
=20
that aren't limiting to the energy industry.  Also, the fact that the class=
=20
meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing.  Other than those=
=20
things, I can't imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment.  I=20
especially don't understand why every single person didn't drop for Enron. =
 I=20

From John Massey  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):

lectures (from industry)
Keith Brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small=

portion of the class time -

Way to make Better:

From Ross Mesquita  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):

To be honest, a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific.  =
=20
When energy applications were presented, it seemed more like general financ=
e=20
questions were reworded to include energy lingo.  We had some very good=20
speakers, but for the most part, I did not feel like the 6 hours of class h=
ad=20
enough energy focus.  I assumed that this would get better as the program=
=20
progressed.

One reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that Energy=20
Finance is a very specific focus.  I would have probably not enrolled in th=
e=20
Energy Finance program had it been available in my first year.  I did not=
=20
know enough about energy at that time and I had returned to B-school to=20
consider several career options -- i.e., investment banking, corporate=20
finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, etc.  As a new MBA student, I would n=
ot=20
want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies. =20

Here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many MBAs--

My interest in Enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa. =

I was a participant in the inaugural Energy Finance program in the Fall of=
=20

 =20
Other notable speakers were Jeff Sandefer (independent business consultant=

perspective as to the ""basics"" of the energy business.

The class was structured via a team-based instruction approach, with 3=20
professors team-teaching a 6-hour credit course.  None of the 3 professors=

had any product knowledge of the energy business.  Of the 3 professors, 2=

were research focussed/tenured with little credibility in ""teaching.""  One =

As is the case for UT's finance program in general, and energy finance in=

v.weldon@enron.com,"Folks,

Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the 
petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged 
drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and 
possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these 
assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the 
estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other 
facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.

Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial 
complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to 
experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties 
identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado, 
Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine 
whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.


Thanks,

Charlie

"
v.weldon@enron.com,"Folks,

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments


It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.


Thanks,

Charlie

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,

v.weldon@enron.com,"Folks,

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments


It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.


Thanks,

Charlie

"
v.weldon@enron.com,"Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.  Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum.
The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.   (Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now)

Thanks,

Charlie"
v.weldon@enron.com,"The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

Subject:	Ft Pierce


A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   Trucks need pumps.
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3""?     3""
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    Standard or 3 inch disconnects

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  Need 200K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   Dyed
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  
9) Commercial start date of plan     Tank to be ready on 5/15/2001

Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.


Thanks again,

 "
v.weldon@enron.com,"Kim,

The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.  I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.  I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.  Sorry for the confusion.

Let me know if you need any more assistance.


Thanks,

Charlie

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

v.weldon@enron.com,"Glad to hear Buddy is getting better.  I assume we still need rain but are doing OK given the good rain 2 weeks ago.

We may come this weekend or next.  Will know tonight."
v.weldon@enron.com,"Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is 
due to our analysis and advice.

I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything?

As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of 
young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in 
my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but 
our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C 
swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr 
third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 
point that's about 18"" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him 
as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to 
you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really 
would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your 
own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move 
nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good 
photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 
281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out.

Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next 
year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet.

Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as 
scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell?


Later,

Thank you very much for your obvious interest and commitment to doing a high 
quality job in your PRC representative role.  Per your request, I am 
attaching my resume and a brief outline of my contributions during the last 
few months. 

I am currently in my first rotation as an Associate which I  began this past 
summer following graduation from UT with an MBA in Energy Finance.   I am 
assigned to Vince Kaminski's Research Group on the Market Fundamentals Team.  
This team is commonly referred to as the ""Weather Group"" and is headed by my 
supervisor, Mike Roberts.  We are located on the gas trading floor (32nd) and 
provide direct support to all the gas desks as well as weather derivatives 
trading.

Thanks again for your interest and I am looking forward to meeting you.

Dear all,

I believe that I will be your global PRC Representative on the 12th/13th of 
December.  For those who don't know me, I'm currently VP Trading & Risk 
Management in our S?o Paulo office, dealing with power and gas.  I'm very 
glad to be one of the reps in PRC, despite the work involved, because I truly 
believe that the best assets of our company are its employees.  I want to do 
my best to represent you fairly and actively.

In order to facilitate my task, I would really appreciate that all of you 
forward to me, by email:

1. a list of your accomplishments in year 2000 (should be not more than 10 to 
12 bullet points, telegraphic style)
2. a decently recent resume, that shows your school, previous work experience 
and start date at Enron.
3. a list of all of your rotations at Enron since hired.

4. In addition, I commit to call your supervisor as listed in PEP system to 
discuss your performance

5. I would also like to meet all of you before PRC meetings: I believe that 
you are either based in South America or in Houston (if that was not the 
case, please let me know by email, we'll speak on the phone).  For those 
based in S?o Paulo, call me and visit at our mutual convenience during the 
week of 4 to 8 December.  For those based in Houston, please call Samira (her 
phone is (55) 11 5503 1200) and schedule a half-hour meeting with me on 
Monday December 11, if you are in town.  I will be in Houston and should stay 
in 3AC1439 (or not far from there).  If you are based in Houston but out of 
town the 11th, let me know in advance, I'll speak to you on the phone.

I hope we'll run this process smoothly.  I look forward to meeting all of you,

Remi

Thanks,

v.weldon@enron.com,"Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around 
again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that 
sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of 
$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. 
The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the 
rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering 
aftershocks
 throughout the U.S. energy community. 

As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California 
has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and 
the uncertain 
profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing 
sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. 

The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, 
Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are 
facing the
 prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity 
purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge 
their customers
 for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the 
gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. 

The risks to Enron are two-fold. 

For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the 
state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the 
company does
 operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a 
considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global 
revenue
 streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default 
payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the 
region. 

More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may 
pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis 
abates. Some also
 fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as 
regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended 
economic consequences. 

Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was 
deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination 
along the way. And a 
strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have 
pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. 

The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best 
course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E 
and Edison's
 ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the 
burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. 

Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks 
on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last 
week. The initial
 euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts 
will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic 
economic
 growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, 
we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized 
defensive plays
 like Enron. 

We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been 
overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was
 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in 
the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly 
in natural 
gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an 
environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. 

In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth 
help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the 
future. The 
markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and 
Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next 
year.
An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send 
profits measurably higher in the long term. 

Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, 
according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. 
Although the 
stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term 
volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the 
market 
approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going 
forward
 "
v.weldon@enron.com,"I don't disagree with your view, but I wouldn't count broadband out yet.  It 
may be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.  If it 
doesn't then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.

Over the past 90 days, fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork

new-power/alternative energy industries. Unlike broader energy funds, this 
pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities 
sector, namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities 
unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways 
to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car.

Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns 
for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to 
analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you 
might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or 
year or whatever.  I c an help you do this if you want.    Remember that this 
is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering 
that the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate 
what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get 
you the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.

When Melissa gets her pictures developed, can you see if they can put

Hey Dude,

How was the superbowl gathering?  You were cracking me up when I called
the other evening.  Next time, just tell Melissa to let you sleep. :)

This weekend was pretty low key.  I purchased some really good books on
web marketing.  I've been studying them, and in the next couple of
months, I'm going to put together an agressive plan to market the web
site.  I will send you copies of the details for your review.

In the meantime there is some computer coding and other structural stuff
I need to get in place for the web site to be easier to maintain and
update.

Later,

Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you 
requested.    I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in 
many of the cases the dataset is limited.  Additionally, I added some other 
stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not 
the exact station requested.  To firm up whether or not these surrogate 
stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.  I assume 
whoever needs this info has one.

Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.  This file is a good 
representation of the type of data available on the CD.  It may not be 
perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better 
data from any other source.   (Not that I will give up though)

Energy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear=
t=20
of the new economy.=20
 =20
Enron (NYSE: ENE) President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling=20
hates his office, a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company's=
=20
downtown
Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its=
=20
haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy=
=20
markets=20
were highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron's three=
=20
commodity-trading floors =01* the company's nerve centers, where it buys an=
d=20
sells products=20
ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20
often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=
=20
traders. ""That's=20
how you find out what's going on,"" he says.

Skilling doesn't think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=
t=20
like an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=
=20
online
 presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=
g=20
to capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=
=20
and electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20
industries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20
insatiable demand,=20
has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=
=20
their customers. That suits Enron just fine.

New Economy Initiatives
The company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=
=20
its regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation's largest buyer
 and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=
=20
trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=
s=20
really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron's new-economy=
=20
initiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=
ng=20
system, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=
=20
more than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20
Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=
=20
delivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading
 bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20
million in revenue for the first nine months of this year.

Although energy remains Enron's main source of revenue and earnings,=20
management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=
ap
 into new markets. ""In five years, we will be a substantially different=20
company,"" says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. ""Underlying=20
everything we=20
do is the ability to make markets more efficient."" Along with bandwidth,=20
Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=
s=20
trading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=
=20
and data storage. ""Trading is the ultimate scalable concept,"" adds Skilling=
.=20
""We're
 using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20
potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited.""

Investors have bought into Enron's vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=
h=20
at a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=
e=20
big
 question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20
Enron's stock price and what happens if the company's broadband strategy=20
doesn't=20
unfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.

""We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20
suited for the changing economy.""
=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron

Company Culture
Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20
management down, employees have little doubt that they're creating=20
revolutionary
 new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20
Enron's headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20
ticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron's stock price.

Management
Ken Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=
=20
the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=
=20
where he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=
=20
forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being
deregulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=
es=20
could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=
s.=20
But=20
with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=
=20
and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The
 new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =
a=20
trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=
=20
process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=
=20
in the 1990s.

Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=
h.=20
""Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known,"" sa=
ys=20
Lay,=20
who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20
consultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. ""I've made it clea=
r=20
for
 some time that he's my successor."" The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=
y=20
joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when
 describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu=
l=20
but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future.

Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20
bottom. ""We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=
d=20
developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas,"" Lay says. Take Michae=
l=20
Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=
=20
came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=
t=20
begins its operations later this year, he will run it.

Wholesale Energy
Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=
=20
still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=
=20
year,=20
nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20
energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20
risk-management=20
products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=
om=20
its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=
=20
bought=20
from other energy producers with excess capacity.

The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20
EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=
=20
Margins
 are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =
of=20
electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just=
=20
to=20
make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =
it=20
to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20
contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=
=20
principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=
=20
the product,=20
be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20
wholesale energy business average one to three percent.

Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=
r=20
than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=
ce=20
moves. ""Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20
modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20
throughout=20
the country,"" says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=
s=20
who closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20

ng=20
cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th=
at=20
could affect=20
supply and demand.

Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=
=20
deregulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20
Scandinavia=20
in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20
making markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20
still loom large and=20
national differences present formidable hurdles. ""We're the only company wi=
th=20
pan-European operations,"" says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy
 unit. ""There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20
difficult.""

Broadband Operations
The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20
bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=
y
 market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=
s=20
gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20
being deployed,=20
""the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in,"" says Kenneth=
=20
Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. ""Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=
g=20
traded like=20
a commodity.""

Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=
=20
carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest
 (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=
=20
sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=
=20
carriers,
 and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=
=20
for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20
15,000 miles
 and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.

Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=
=20
which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=
s=20
into=20
paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20
demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=
s=20
of=20
time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=
f its=20
CEO to its offices around the globe.

The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20
monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=
n=20
a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=
 a=20
speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron
 delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20
quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20
months. Both
 Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20
annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=
gy=20
contributed=20
in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=
=20
broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=
=20
$2=20
billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).

The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering=
=20
streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches
 made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=
=20
along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system
 is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=
ge=20
from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=
E:=20
BBI),=20
which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=
=20
Enron's network. ""Video will be the king application,"" Skilling says. ""That=
's=20
where=20
it's all going to happen.""

Other Growth Drivers
Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million=
=20
for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20
retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20
30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=
=20
stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=
=20
million in the process.

Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=
=20
businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=
r=20
operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=
=20
from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20
energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20
gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group
 (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=
=20
billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate=
=20
properties. ""The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're=
=20
going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail,"" says Marty Sunde,
head of the group's North American unit.

Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=
t=20
sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20
in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=
=20
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=
=20
target to=20
land $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year's total.=
=20
""There's no reason this business can't roughly double in each of the next f=
ew=20
years,""=20
Lay says.

""Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=
=20
but their track record warrants that.""
=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham

The Competition
Some of Enron's trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=
he=20
deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.
 Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=
nd=20
called ""Enron Jr."" by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20
electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=
=20
same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is
 much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including=
=20
Aquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20
energy-trading=20
system to rival EnronOnline.

Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=
e=20
(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards
 for companies to find trading partners. They don't actually deliver the=20
product, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20
business,=20
Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=
l=20
utilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron's geographic scope.

""It's a challenge to value Enron's stock, because it's such a hybrid. It=20
always seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations.""
=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.

What It's Worth
Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=
=20
its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20
also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=
t=20
to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business=
es
 are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=
=20
$80, Enron's pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=
=20
valued at $5,
wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=
=20
$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=
=20
energy=20
is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20
year, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron's projected total EBIT. And=
=20
wholesale=20
energy's EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=
he=20
next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20
markets.=20
Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=
=20
broadband,=20
not to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=
ng=20
argues, Enron's stock is easily worth $130.

Analysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20
higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=
s=20
still=20
a couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=
=20
Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20
potential=20
of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=
=20
market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=
=20
mid-1990s.
 Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than=
=20
Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=
=20
for bandwidth
 would make Enron a $100 stock.

Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20
Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=
r=20
=01* and
 maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=

Subject: Stagecoach gas questions

Hi guys,

I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the 
answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the 
rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if 
you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this 
under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you 
guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso 
and ask questions they've already answered.


1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver 
this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?

2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If 
interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm 
storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    

3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP ""cost of 
carry"" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are 
there any ""IN STORAGE""  transfer costs? 

4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?

5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach 
project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES 
inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?

6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a 
basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be 
firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  

7.  If possible, can EES ""pick"" an alternate delivery point as our primary 
point of delivery for this project? 


I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set 
aside - will this work for you Mark?

Thanks,

Andrew

ever on ranch.  Didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 140-150 lbs.

2) Mike Lehnert (Mickey's son ) killed an 17"", 11 point with a double main 
beam, four brow tines, and a drop tine.

3) Travis shot a 16""  9 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points.

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas 
(9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the 
following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the 
CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The 
desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side 
of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    
It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the 
TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) 
size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie

v.weldon@enron.com,"Vince, 

Mr. Horn's request has been taken care of.  He has the data he wanted and

Charlie"
v.weldon@enron.com,"Indeed.  If the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as 
intensely cold as today's and the present hint at another Arctic blast to 
directly at the East Coast next weekend continues then we could approach 
$10.  Pretty risky business here being short or long, eh?

A frozen precip event in the Deep South and Houston is not unlikely next 
week."
v.weldon@enron.com,"The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the 
Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave 
Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie 
Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final 
engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall 
runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is 
expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are 
dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690.  This 
equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in 
only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly 
capacity requirements:


   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	
Capacity From East Desk
May	22,300	0	22,300	0
June	22,300	0	22,300	0
July	22,300	0	22,300	0
August	22,300	0	22,300	0
September	22,300	0	22,300	0

  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity 
from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas 
requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is 
dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to 
run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus 
leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This 
equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 
16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused 
capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month 
as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities 
available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will 
come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




 
   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 
(Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0

NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from 
the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each 
dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are 
financially ""not doing so well"" at present due in some part to a lack of 
hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme 
cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and

BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS
More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV
affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit,
and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow
the storms.
           In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found
out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent
who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into
a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -
with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the
storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13
percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.
           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at
weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,
delivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over
twice the average December monthly rating to date.
           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market
ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also
was within the top 10."
v.weldon@enron.com,"Keep trying.  We are definitely interested.  How much does a pair of tickets 
to an inaugural ball run?"
v.weldon@enron.com,"In the case of the Texas Society Ball, it would be cheaper to join for $20 
and buy the tickets for $125.   This does sound like a good one to go to 
based on the Website but sounds like we are out of luck there.  I imagine 
(hope) that the other balls are comparable.

I found several airline quotes for ~$250 as you indicated. "
v.weldon@enron.com,"Had a great time this weekend.  I'm sure glad that Travis got another good 
buck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the 
next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty 
possible next year.

I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her 
painting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she ""owed"" her but nothing more 
than that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that 
she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the 
money.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and 
Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this 
week as well.   If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach the 
subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.

Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she 
wasn't able to ""prove"" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  
She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not 
working outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our 
house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of 
things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If 
there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on 
these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good 
Christmas for everyone.

Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There 
is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can 
help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I'm sure you see 
my point of view here.

Subject: JA Company Program


Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

Subject: Stagecoach gas questions

Hi guys,

I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the 
answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the 
rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if 
you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this 
under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you 
guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso 
and ask questions they've already answered.


1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver 
this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?

2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If 
interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm 
storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    

3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP ""cost of 
carry"" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are 
there any ""IN STORAGE""  transfer costs? 

4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?

5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach 
project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES 
inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?

6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a 
basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be 
firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  

7.  If possible, can EES ""pick"" an alternate delivery point as our primary 
point of delivery for this project? 


I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set 
aside - will this work for you Mark?

Thanks,

Andrew

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas 
(9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the 
following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the 
CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The 
desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side 
of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    
It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the 
TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) 
size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie



  "
v.weldon@enron.com,"The best summary of what is going on here that I have read recently:

http://www.infoxpress.com/reviewtracker/reprints.asp?page_id=814"
v.weldon@enron.com,"The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the 
Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave 
Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie 
Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final 
engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall 
runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is 
expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are 
dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690.  This 
equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in 
only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly 
capacity requirements:


   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	
Capacity From East Desk
May	22,300	0	22,300	0
June	22,300	0	22,300	0
July	22,300	0	22,300	0
August	22,300	0	22,300	0
September	22,300	0	22,300	0

  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity 
from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas 
requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is 
dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to 
run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus 
leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This 
equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 
16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused 
capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month 
as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities 
available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will 
come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




 
   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 
(Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0

NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from 
the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each 
dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

v.weldon@enron.com,"John,

Based on yesterday's (5/9/01) curves, and applying spreads from our previous

Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns 
for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to 
analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you 
might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or 
year or whatever.  I c an help you do this if you want.    Remember that this 
is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering 
that the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate

you the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.

Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

v.weldon@enron.com,"Can there not be an argument made to dive into TXN?  It's trading at 25 
forward P/E (2001) with a 5-year consensus growth rate of 24.2.  A PEG of ~1 
on a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great 
market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, 
right?  What's your view?

The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this 
is a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got 
the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin 
pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high 
growth in technology?  I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of 
the megacap stocks with great market positions, like TXN, are sure tempting.

Nasdaq down 46% from its March high and not looking good at the open.  This 
could be a ""buy while there is blood in the streets"" opportunity."
v.weldon@enron.com,"Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around 
again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that 
sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of 
$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. 
The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the 
rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering 
aftershocks
 throughout the U.S. energy community. 

As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California 
has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and 
the uncertain 
profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing 
sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. 

The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, 
Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are 
facing the
 prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity 
purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge 
their customers
 for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the 
gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. 

The risks to Enron are two-fold. 

For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the 
state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the 
company does
 operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a 
considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global 
revenue
 streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default 
payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the 
region. 

More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may 
pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis 
abates. Some also
 fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as 
regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended 
economic consequences. 

Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was 
deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination 
along the way. And a 
strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have 
pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. 

The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best 
course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E 
and Edison's
 ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the 
burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. 

Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks 
on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last 
week. The initial
 euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts 
will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic 
economic
 growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, 
we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized 
defensive plays
 like Enron. 

We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been 
overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was
 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in 
the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly 
in natural 
gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an 
environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. 

In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth 
help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the 
future. The 
markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and 
Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next 
year.
An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send 
profits measurably higher in the long term. 

Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, 
according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. 
Although the 
stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term 
volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the 
market 
approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going 
forward

often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=
=20
traders. ""That's=20
how you find out what's going on,"" he says.

Skilling doesn't think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=
t=20
like an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=

to capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=

and electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20
industries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20
insatiable demand,=20
has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=
=20
their customers. That suits Enron just fine.

New Economy Initiatives
The company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=
=20
its regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation's largest buyer
 and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=
=20
trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=
s=20
really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron's new-economy=
=20
initiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=
ng=20
system, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=
=20
more than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20
Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=
=20
delivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading
 bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20
million in revenue for the first nine months of this year.

Although energy remains Enron's main source of revenue and earnings,=20
management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=
ap
 into new markets. ""In five years, we will be a substantially different=20
company,"" says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. ""Underlying=20
everything we=20
do is the ability to make markets more efficient."" Along with bandwidth,=20
Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=

trading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=

and data storage. ""Trading is the ultimate scalable concept,"" adds Skilling=

""We're

""We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20
suited for the changing economy.""
=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron

Company Culture
Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20
management down, employees have little doubt that they're creating=20
revolutionary
 new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20
Enron's headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20
ticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron's stock price.

Management
Ken Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=
=20
the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=
=20
where he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=
=20
forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being
deregulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=
es=20
could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=
s.=20
But=20
with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=
=20
and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The
 new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =
a=20
trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=
=20
process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=
=20
in the 1990s.

Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=
h.=20
""Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known,"" sa=

Lay,=20
who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20

r=20
for
 some time that he's my successor."" The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=
y=20
joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when
 describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu=
l=20
but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future.

Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20
bottom. ""We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=
d=20
developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas,"" Lay says. Take Michae=

Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=
=20
came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=
t=20
begins its operations later this year, he will run it.

Wholesale Energy
Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=
=20
still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=
=20
year,=20
nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20
energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20
risk-management=20
products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=
om=20
its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=
=20
bought=20
from other energy producers with excess capacity.

The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20
EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=
=20
Margins
 are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =
of=20
electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just=
=20
to=20
make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =
it=20
to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20
contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=
=20
principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=
=20
the product,=20
be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20
wholesale energy business average one to three percent.

Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=
r=20
than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=
ce=20
moves. ""Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20
modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20
throughout=20
the country,"" says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=

Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=

in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20

th=20
pan-European operations,"" says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy
 unit. ""There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20
difficult.""

Broadband Operations
The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20
bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=
y
 market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=
s=20
gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20
being deployed,=20
""the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in,"" says Kenneth=
=20
Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. ""Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=
g=20
traded like=20
a commodity.""

Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=
=20
carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest
 (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=
=20
sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=
=20
carriers,
 and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=
=20
for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20
15,000 miles
 and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.

Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=
=20
which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=
s=20
into=20
paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20
demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=
s=20
of=20
time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=
f its=20
CEO to its offices around the globe.

The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20
monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=
n=20
a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=
 a=20
speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron
 delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20
quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20
months. Both
 Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20
annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=
gy=20
contributed=20
in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=
=20
broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=
=20
$2=20
billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).

The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering=
=20
streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches
 made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=
=20
along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system
 is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=
ge=20
from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=
E:=20
BBI),=20
which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=
=20
Enron's network. ""Video will be the king application,"" Skilling says. ""That=
's=20
where=20
it's all going to happen.""

Other Growth Drivers
Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million=
=20
for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20
retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20
30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=
=20
stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=
=20
million in the process.

Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=
=20
businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=
r=20
operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=
=20
from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20
energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20
gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group
 (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=
=20
billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate=
=20
properties. ""The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're=
=20
going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail,"" says Marty Sunde,
head of the group's North American unit.

Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=
t=20

The Competition

 Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=

called ""Enron Jr."" by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20
electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=

same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is
 much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including=

system to rival EnronOnline.

Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=

Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=

What It's Worth
Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=

its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20
also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=
t=20
to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business=

valued at $5,
wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=

$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=

of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=

market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=

mid-1990s.
 Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than=
=20
Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=

for bandwidth
 would make Enron a $100 stock.

Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20
Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=

Social Responsibility

"
v.weldon@enron.com,"The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0

Based on yesterday's (5/9/01) curves, and applying spreads from our previous quotes, the new updated notionl bid is $4.51/MMBTU.  Let me know if you need any more assistnace.

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie

Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer 
Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.

Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent 
earnings warning.  Among other things, they mention that they had tough 
comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.  I believe they 
are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my 
opinion.

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001219/bs/rayovac_outlook_dc_1.html


One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The 
Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging 
against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are 
financially ""not doing so well"" at present due in some part to a lack of 
hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme 
cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and 
should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.

Please let me know how I may be of assistance.


Thanks,

The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.  I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.  I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.

Charlie,  I just wanted to say thanks for coming down to watch the kids
even though both of the games were cancelled.  It meant a lot that
you'll made the attempt.  We really enjoyed having you and I hope we can
continue to get together on a more regular basis without the rest of the
world with us.  It is nice for Melissa and I to have time to visit and
it is nice for the kids to get to know each other and to have a
relationship.  I am going to teach Blake how to wrap his legs around my
waist when I carry him - I am looking forward to the birth of my

Subject:	Ft Pierce


A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   Trucks need pumps.
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3""?     3""
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    Standard or 3 inch disconnects

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  Need 200K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   Dyed
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  
9) Commercial start date of plan     Tank to be ready on 5/15/2001
10) Any other issue to be discussed"

Poise / Confidence    	         1	No problem here.  Suzette is quite confident without being cocky.	
Leadership Potential   	         1	 It is very easy to imagine Suzette in a leadership role.	
Personality / Enthusiasm    	         1	Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being   a Texas MBA student.	
Maturity    	         2	She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students.	
Clarity of Professional Focus    	         2	Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. 	


Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. 

We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.


Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. 

Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

v.weldon@enron.com,"The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

  "
v.weldon@enron.com,"John,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie


 
  "
v.weldon@enron.com,"Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is 
due to our analysis and advice.

I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything?

As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of 
young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in 
my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but 
our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C 
swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr 
third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 
point that's about 18"" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him 
as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to 
you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really 
would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your 
own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move 
nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good 
photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 
281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out.

Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next 
year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet.

Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as 
scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell?

Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns 
for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to 
analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you 
might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or

is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering

right?  What's your view?

The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this 
is a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got 
the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin 
pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high 
growth in technology?  I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of

Hey Dude,

How was the superbowl gathering?  You were cracking me up when I called
the other evening.  Next time, just tell Melissa to let you sleep. :)

This weekend was pretty low key.  I purchased some really good books on
web marketing.  I've been studying them, and in the next couple of
months, I'm going to put together an agressive plan to market the web
site.  I will send you copies of the details for your review.

In the meantime there is some computer coding and other structural stuff
I need to get in place for the web site to be easier to maintain and
update.

Later,

Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you 
requested.    I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in 
many of the cases the dataset is limited.  Additionally, I added some other 
stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not 
the exact station requested.  To firm up whether or not these surrogate 
stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.  I assume 
whoever needs this info has one.

Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.  This file is a good 
representation of the type of data available on the CD.  It may not be 
perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better 
data from any other source.   (Not that I will give up though)

Energy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear=
t=20
of the new economy.=20
 =20
Enron (NYSE: ENE) President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling=20
hates his office, a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company's=
=20
downtown
Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its=
=20
haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy=
=20
markets=20
were highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron's three=
=20
commodity-trading floors =01* the company's nerve centers, where it buys an=
d=20
sells products=20
ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20
often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=
=20
traders. ""That's=20
how you find out what's going on,"" he says.

Skilling doesn't think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=
t=20
like an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=
=20
online
 presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=
g=20
to capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=
=20
and electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20
industries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20
insatiable demand,=20
has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=
=20
their customers. That suits Enron just fine.

New Economy Initiatives
The company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=
=20
its regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation's largest buyer
 and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=
=20
trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=
s=20
really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron's new-economy=
=20
initiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=
ng=20
system, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=
=20
more than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20
Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=
=20
delivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading
 bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20
million in revenue for the first nine months of this year.

Although energy remains Enron's main source of revenue and earnings,=20
management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=
ap
 into new markets. ""In five years, we will be a substantially different=20
company,"" says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. ""Underlying=20
everything we=20
do is the ability to make markets more efficient."" Along with bandwidth,=20
Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=
s=20
trading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=
=20
and data storage. ""Trading is the ultimate scalable concept,"" adds Skilling=
.=20
""We're
 using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20
potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited.""

Investors have bought into Enron's vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=
h=20
at a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=
e=20
big
 question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20
Enron's stock price and what happens if the company's broadband strategy=20
doesn't=20
unfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.

""We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20
suited for the changing economy.""
=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron

Company Culture
Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20
management down, employees have little doubt that they're creating=20
revolutionary
 new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20
Enron's headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20
ticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron's stock price.

Management
Ken Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=
=20
the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=
=20
where he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=
=20
forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being
deregulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=
es=20
could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=
s.=20
But=20
with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=
=20
and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The
 new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =
a=20
trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=
=20
process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=
=20
in the 1990s.

Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=
h.=20
""Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known,"" sa=
ys=20
Lay,=20
who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20
consultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. ""I've made it clea=
r=20
for
 some time that he's my successor."" The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=
y=20
joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when
 describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu=
l=20
but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future.

Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20
bottom. ""We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=
d=20
developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas,"" Lay says. Take Michae=
l=20
Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=
=20
came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=
t=20
begins its operations later this year, he will run it.

Wholesale Energy
Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=
=20
still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=
=20
year,=20
nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20
energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20
risk-management=20
products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=
om=20
its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=
=20
bought=20
from other energy producers with excess capacity.

The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20
EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=
=20
Margins
 are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =
of=20
electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just=
=20
to=20
make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =
it=20
to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20
contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=
=20
principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=
=20
the product,=20
be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20
wholesale energy business average one to three percent.

Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=
r=20
than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=
ce=20
moves. ""Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20
modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20
throughout=20
the country,"" says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=
s=20
who closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20

ng=20
cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th=
at=20
could affect=20
supply and demand.

Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=
=20
deregulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20
Scandinavia=20
in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20
making markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20
still loom large and=20
national differences present formidable hurdles. ""We're the only company wi=
th=20
pan-European operations,"" says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy
 unit. ""There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20
difficult.""

Broadband Operations
The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20
bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=
y
 market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=
s=20
gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20
being deployed,=20
""the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in,"" says Kenneth=
=20
Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. ""Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=
g=20
traded like=20
a commodity.""

Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=
=20
carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest
 (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=
=20
sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=
=20
carriers,
 and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=
=20
for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20
15,000 miles
 and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.

Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=
=20
which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=
s=20
into=20
paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20
demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=
s=20
of=20
time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=
f its=20
CEO to its offices around the globe.

The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20
monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=
n=20
a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=
 a=20
speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron
 delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20
quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20
months. Both
 Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20
annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=
gy=20
contributed=20
in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=
=20
broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=
=20
$2=20
billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).

The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering=
=20
streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches
 made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=
=20
along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system
 is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=
ge=20
from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=
E:=20
BBI),=20
which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=
=20
Enron's network. ""Video will be the king application,"" Skilling says. ""That=
's=20
where=20
it's all going to happen.""

Other Growth Drivers
Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million=
=20
for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20
retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20
30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=
=20
stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=
=20
million in the process.

Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=
=20
businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=
r=20
operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=
=20
from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20
energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20
gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group
 (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=
=20
billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate=
=20
properties. ""The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're=
=20
going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail,"" says Marty Sunde,
head of the group's North American unit.

Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=
t=20
sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20
in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=
=20
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=
=20
target to=20
land $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year's total.=
=20
""There's no reason this business can't roughly double in each of the next f=
ew=20
years,""=20
Lay says.

""Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=
=20
but their track record warrants that.""
=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham

The Competition
Some of Enron's trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=
he=20
deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.
 Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=
nd=20
called ""Enron Jr."" by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20
electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=
=20
same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is
 much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including=
=20
Aquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20
energy-trading=20
system to rival EnronOnline.

Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=
e=20
(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards
 for companies to find trading partners. They don't actually deliver the=20
product, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20
business,=20
Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=
l=20
utilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron's geographic scope.

""It's a challenge to value Enron's stock, because it's such a hybrid. It=20
always seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations.""
=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.

What It's Worth
Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=
=20
its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20
also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=
t=20
to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business=
es
 are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=
=20
$80, Enron's pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=
=20
valued at $5,
wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=
=20
$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=
=20
energy=20
is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20
year, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron's projected total EBIT. And=
=20
wholesale=20
energy's EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=
he=20
next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20
markets.=20
Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=
=20
broadband,=20
not to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=
ng=20
argues, Enron's stock is easily worth $130.

Analysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20
higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=
s=20
still=20
a couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=
=20
Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20
potential=20
of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=
=20
market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=
=20
mid-1990s.
 Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than=
=20
Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=
=20
for bandwidth
 would make Enron a $100 stock.

Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20
Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=
r=20
=01* and
 maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=
 $92.

Social Responsibility
Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce=
=20
methane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But=
=20
certain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant =
in=20
India, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20
protests=20
against the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20
Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th=
e=20
suppression of dissent and didn't speak out against human rights violations=
.=20
Enron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000
 to improve the community's water and sanitation infrastructures.

The Upside
With less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20
competition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie=
ve=20
the entire=20
market will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20
expand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could=
=20
get a=20
boost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:=
=20
AOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via
 the Internet. Enron's attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi=
a=20
ended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn't one of=
=20
its strengths.=20
So it's relying on IBM's back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and=
=20
AOL's Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power.

The Downside
The much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.=
=20
Currently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and
 Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called=
=20
last-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving=
=20
very=20
slowly. She doesn't expect wide-scale availability of video-on-demand befor=

2004.

Who Needs It?
Enron's mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most=

the times and inept at managing monetary policy in this New Economy.  In 
fact, it was Greenspan's willingness to embrace the New Economy's higher GDP

economic expansion.  While it is true that the Fed's tightening is largely 
responsible for this downturn, it is not solely responsible; and it is the 
Fed's nimbleness over the last month in reversing monetary policy that will 
prevent this downturn from being a mere bump in the road."

Charlie,  I just heard from dad on Tuesday that Nate had died on
Sunday.  He said he and Stacey were going to the funeral.  I emailed
Stacey and told her I hoped she was ok.  Anyway, I don't know how you
feel but if you are sad I hope you are ok also.  I didn't know him - I
had only met him once or twice and that was many, many years ago.  Love,

she did the responsorial psalm last time.  Her two main teachers told
the religion teacher that Elizabeth would have to read again because the

Subject: Stagecoach gas questions

Hi guys,

I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the 
answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the 
rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if 
you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this 
under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you 
guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso 
and ask questions they've already answered.


1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver 
this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?

2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If 
interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm 
storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    

3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP ""cost of 
carry"" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are 
there any ""IN STORAGE""  transfer costs? 

4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?

5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach 
project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES 
inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?

6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a 
basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be 
firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  

7.  If possible, can EES ""pick"" an alternate delivery point as our primary 
point of delivery for this project? 


I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set 
aside - will this work for you Mark?

Thanks,

Andrew

v.weldon@enron.com,"I think the ranch was owned by Jimmy Powell.  It was 20 miles west of Menard 
on Hwy 190.  A great area that's for sure.

Three deer have been killed on the ranch thatI know of so far:

1)  17"", 10 point by Wayne Scroggins that grossed ~135 and is third largest 
ever on ranch.  Didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 140-150 lbs.

2) Mike Lehnert (Mickey's son ) killed an 17"", 11 point with a double main 
beam, four brow tines, and a drop tine.

3) Travis shot a 16""  9 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points.

remember.  Maybe things have turned around for awhile.  I've got some good

v.weldon@enron.com,"John,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas 
(9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the 
following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the 
CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The 
desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side 
of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    
It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the 
TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) 
size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie



  "
v.weldon@enron.com,"John,

Based on yesterday's (5/9/01) curves, and applying spreads from our previous

Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer 
Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.

Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent 
earnings warning.  Among other things, they mention that they had tough 
comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.  I believe they 
are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my 
opinion.

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001219/bs/rayovac_outlook_dc_1.html


One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The 
Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging 
against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are 
financially ""not doing so well"" at present due in some part to a lack of 
hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme 
cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and 
should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.

Please let me know how I may be of assistance.


Thanks,

Charlie


"
v.weldon@enron.com,"This is an excerpt from an internal Weather Channel (Landmark Communications) 
newsletter.....


BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS
More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV
affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit,
and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow
the storms.
           In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found
out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent
who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into
a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -
with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the
storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13
percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.
           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at
weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,
delivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over
twice the average December monthly rating to date.
           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market
ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also
was within the top 10."

buck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the 
next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty 
possible next year.

I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her 
painting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she ""owed"" her but nothing more 
than that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that 
she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the 
money.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and 
Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this

subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.

Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she 
wasn't able to ""prove"" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  
She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not 
working outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our 
house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of 
things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If 
there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on 
these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good 
Christmas for everyone.

Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There 
is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can 
help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I'm sure you see 
my point of view here.

Subject: JA Company Program


Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

Dear all,

I believe that I will be your global PRC Representative on the 12th/13th of 
December.  For those who don't know me, I'm currently VP Trading & Risk 
Management in our S?o Paulo office, dealing with power and gas.  I'm very 
glad to be one of the reps in PRC, despite the work involved, because I truly 
believe that the best assets of our company are its employees.  I want to do 
my best to represent you fairly and actively.

In order to facilitate my task, I would really appreciate that all of you 
forward to me, by email:

1. a list of your accomplishments in year 2000 (should be not more than 10 to 
12 bullet points, telegraphic style)
2. a decently recent resume, that shows your school, previous work experience 
and start date at Enron.
3. a list of all of your rotations at Enron since hired.

4. In addition, I commit to call your supervisor as listed in PEP system to 
discuss your performance

5. I would also like to meet all of you before PRC meetings: I believe that 
you are either based in South America or in Houston (if that was not the 
case, please let me know by email, we'll speak on the phone).  For those 
based in S?o Paulo, call me and visit at our mutual convenience during the 
week of 4 to 8 December.  For those based in Houston, please call Samira (her 
phone is (55) 11 5503 1200) and schedule a half-hour meeting with me on 
Monday December 11, if you are in town.  I will be in Houston and should stay 
in 3AC1439 (or not far from there).  If you are based in Houston but out of 
town the 11th, let me know in advance, I'll speak to you on the phone.

I hope we'll run this process smoothly.  I look forward to meeting all of you,

Remi

v.weldon@enron.com,"Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around 
again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that 
sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of 
$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. 
The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the 
rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering 
aftershocks
 throughout the U.S. energy community. 

As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California 
has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and 
the uncertain 
profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing 
sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. 

The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, 
Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are 
facing the
 prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity 
purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge 
their customers
 for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the 
gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. 

The risks to Enron are two-fold. 

For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the 
state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the 
company does
 operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a 
considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global 
revenue
 streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default 
payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the 
region. 

More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may 
pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis 
abates. Some also
 fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as 
regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended 
economic consequences. 

Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was 
deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination 
along the way. And a 
strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have 
pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. 

The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best 
course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E 
and Edison's
 ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the 
burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. 

Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks 
on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last 
week. The initial
 euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts 
will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic 
economic
 growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, 
we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized 
defensive plays
 like Enron. 

We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been 
overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was
 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in 
the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly 
in natural 
gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an 
environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. 

In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth 
help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the 
future. The 
markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and 
Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next 
year.
An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send 
profits measurably higher in the long term. 

Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, 
according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. 
Although the 
stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term 
volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the 
market 
approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going 
forward

Over the past 90 days, fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork 
with regulators for the first four mutual funds focusing on the 
new-power/alternative energy industries. Unlike broader energy funds, this 
pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities 
sector, namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities 
unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways 
to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car.

Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the
business side of things.  In return, I'll answer any questions you have
on politics.  I've now been involved with Republican politics for almost
exactly seven years, so I have a little bit of experience with politics
and leadership. :)

When will Melissa have your pictures developed?

Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.
Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists

=09I believe everything we have been saying: we have the best business mode=

and we have all of our capabilities intact.  We are poised for even greater=
 growth.  Even so, we will not be able to fight off the negatives on our st=
ock and on our reputation right now.  Our problem is not a problem about ge=
tting the message out. =20

=09Part of the problem we can't do anything about:  almost all equities hav=
e suffered this year.  But part of our problem (the part we can do somethin=
g about) is that we are faced with too many bad, but true (or at least plau=
sible), allegations that we have to deal with every time we try to tell our=
 story.  These current circumstances are not necessarily bad:  I think we c=
an use them as a great opportunity to drive some overdue changes.  But no a=
mount of communication or ""spin"" will work right now.  We have to directly =
address the issues.=20

=09The difficult allegations we face include:

Creative or aggressive accounting (both in reporting and deal structuring);
Black box reporting;
Over-hyping of the stock or the prospects for unproven businesses;
A near mercenary culture which encourages organizations to hide problems (u=
ntil those problems have become very big), discourages cooperation and team=
work, and drives off people who demand at least a modicum of civility in th=
eir work environment.

=09I have some answers.  First, I would hold our actions to the standard we=
 apply to everything else:  the market standard.  We should do the economic=
ally rational thing in every transaction and business and let the chips fal=
l where they may.  Instead of tying ourselves in a knot about managing earn=
ings or write downs or avoiding an asset sale because it's on the books for=
 more than the market, we should just make the rational economic decision. =
=20

=09Second, I would open up our reporting.  Make it as transparent as the an=
alysts want; indeed, set a new standard for transparency and integrity.  I =
know we are looking at these things and have been for some time.  I also re=
alize that at some levels of disclosure we risk disclosing positions.  I'm =
just saying we should drive right up to the edge. =20

=09Third, I think IR should be all about the facts: disclosing facts and co=
rrecting misunderstandings.  I would not ""spin"" in this function.  Our audi=
ence is too sophisticated.  If we make the economically rational decisions =
over and over, the stock price will come along.  We have lost credibility b=
y overhyping businesses we haven't proven yet and it's hard to see why we d=
o it.  To get early credit in the stock price?  I'd rather wait.  To prove =
that we are a growth company?  I think a track record of growth and a ratio=
nal and circumspect discussion of our opportunities will take care of that.=
  I want us to be a company which is bold in its business moves, not in its=
 approach to analysts or in its accounting.  The reputation I would like to=
 have with investors is that we never overstate, we never dissappoint and t=
hat we can always be trusted.  I am not being critical of our team.  We hav=

s done anything wrong or ineffectively.  I simply believe that it is time t=
o reassess how we do these things (and I don't consider my organization to =
be exempt from that same reassessment).

=09Finally, our culture.  As I said the other day, there may be a relativel=
y small number of individuals who are commercially successful, well paid, r=
egularly promoted who have little or no respect for their coworkers or othe=
r human beings in general.  When others see them rewarded, it matters not a=
t all what we say about our values.  Dealing with a few people directly wil=
l send a message that spreads like wildfire through the organization.  Addi=
tionally, compensation structures and a PRC process which explicitly reward=
s teamwork (and which includes broader representation than just the commerc=
ial groups) will go a very long way toward changing the level of civility i=
n the organization.

=09I hope it's clear to you that I love this place.  I have poured my heart=
 and soul into it.  It is the finest organization I have ever been part of.=
  Like everyone, I have had some time to reflect lately.  I have recommitte=
d myself to this place and to your leadership.  Part of that recommitment w=
ill be my concerted effort to make things even better."

j..kean@enron.com," 
"
j..kean@enron.com,"Attached are the drafts as of Sunday:

     "
j..kean@enron.com,"revised with kll comments (still need to include all employee memo).

   

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"including all employee memo

 

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"=09I know you are getting an impossible volume of advice right now . . .  b=
ut that's not going to stop me from piling on a little more.

=09I believe everything we have been saying: we have the best business mode=
l, we are making great money, we are growing, we are addressing our issues =
and we have all of our capabilities intact.  We are poised for even greater=
 growth.  Even so, we will not be able to fight off the negatives on our st=
ock and on our reputation right now.  Our problem is not a problem about ge=
tting the message out. =20

=09Part of the problem we can't do anything about:  almost all equities hav=
e suffered this year.  But part of our problem (the part we can do somethin=
g about) is that we are faced with too many bad, but true (or at least plau=
sible), allegations that we have to deal with every time we try to tell our=
 story.  These current circumstances are not necessarily bad:  I think we c=
an use them as a great opportunity to drive some overdue changes.  But no a=
mount of communication or ""spin"" will work right now.  We have to directly =
address the issues.=20

=09The difficult allegations we face include:

Creative or aggressive accounting (both in reporting and deal structuring);
Black box reporting;
Over-hyping of the stock or the prospects for unproven businesses;
A near mercenary culture which encourages organizations to hide problems (u=
ntil those problems have become very big), discourages cooperation and team=
work, and drives off people who demand at least a modicum of civility in th=
eir work environment.

=09I have some answers.  First, I would hold our actions to the standard we=
 apply to everything else:  the market standard.  We should do the economic=
ally rational thing in every transaction and business and let the chips fal=
l where they may.  Instead of tying ourselves in a knot about managing earn=
ings or write downs or avoiding an asset sale because it's on the books for=
 more than the market, we should just make the rational economic decision. =
=20

=09Second, I would open up our reporting.  Make it as transparent as the an=
alysts want; indeed, set a new standard for transparency and integrity.  I =
know we are looking at these things and have been for some time.  I also re=
alize that at some levels of disclosure we risk disclosing positions.  I'm =
just saying we should drive right up to the edge. =20

=09Third, I think IR should be all about the facts: disclosing facts and co=
rrecting misunderstandings.  I would not ""spin"" in this function.  Our audi=
ence is too sophisticated.  If we make the economically rational decisions =
over and over, the stock price will come along.  We have lost credibility b=
y overhyping businesses we haven't proven yet and it's hard to see why we d=
o it.  To get early credit in the stock price?  I'd rather wait.  To prove =
that we are a growth company?  I think a track record of growth and a ratio=
nal and circumspect discussion of our opportunities will take care of that.=
  I want us to be a company which is bold in its business moves, not in its=
 approach to analysts or in its accounting.  The reputation I would like to=
 have with investors is that we never overstate, we never dissappoint and t=
hat we can always be trusted.  I am not being critical of our team.  We hav=
e the best, most organized, hardest working, and most effective IR team in =
the business.  I am just concerned that we have sent them speeding down the=
 wrong path.  Similarly, I am not critical of our accounting organization. =
 We have the finest accounting organization in the industry.  They need to =
be the best in order to get sensible accounting rules and interpretations t=
o accurately reflect the results of our unique and innovative business.  Th=
ey need to minimize our tax exposures etc.  I am not arguing that anyone ha=
s done anything wrong or ineffectively.  I simply believe that it is time t=
o reassess how we do these things (and I don't consider my organization to =
be exempt from that same reassessment).

=09Finally, our culture.  As I said the other day, there may be a relativel=
y small number of individuals who are commercially successful, well paid, r=
egularly promoted who have little or no respect for their coworkers or othe=
r human beings in general.  When others see them rewarded, it matters not a=
t all what we say about our values.  Dealing with a few people directly wil=
l send a message that spreads like wildfire through the organization.  Addi=
tionally, compensation structures and a PRC process which explicitly reward=
s teamwork (and which includes broader representation than just the commerc=
ial groups) will go a very long way toward changing the level of civility i=
n the organization.

=09I hope it's clear to you that I love this place.  I have poured my heart=
 and soul into it.  It is the finest organization I have ever been part of.=
  Like everyone, I have had some time to reflect lately.  I have recommitte=
d myself to this place and to your leadership.  Part of that recommitment w=
ill be my concerted effort to make things even better."

j..kean@enron.com,"We should get the focus off of ""micromanaging FERC"".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the ""gerrymandering"" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a ""camel"" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

30 August 2001

Request: Is ICE regulated by the CFTC?
Response: The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission only to the extent the markets are made on the exchange for products that have already been designated futures contracts by the commission. 
 
ICE announced 28 August that its new clearing house, the formerly the London Clearing House of the International Petroleum Exchange, would clear cash-settled U.S. oil swaps for West Texas Intermediate crude and U.S. natural gas swaps at the Henry Hub. Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the U.S., the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well. The fact that the futures trade on another exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, is immaterial.
 
The ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Section 5b(d) of the Commodities Exchange, Act, as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA),  provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements, contracts, or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated by the Commission as a contract market for such agreements, contracts, or transactions before the date of enactment of this section. This provision captures all futures clearing organizations that have ever cleared any futures contracts for designated contract markets before the CFMA became effective.
 
DCOs of both traditional open outcry exchanges, as well as electronic-only exchanges, have been approved by the CFTC. Applications by the Intercontinental Exchange and Hedge Street, Inc., appear to be pending.  A CFTC official told Intellibridge that few applications to create DCOs have been submitted since the CFMA was signed.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"Paul Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on):

Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood
A ""white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.

Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's ""panel"" on or about Oct 9.

	Late on October 25th, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Center.  We are in communication with law enforcement authorities who have informed us that the threat is not specific and is unsubstantiated.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  In addition, today's Big E Cafe event has been cancelled.

	Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

With his retirement (eff Aug 1) he is asking Ken Lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of Enron.  My inclination is to simply resign the Chairmanship, but there are other options: let Terry continue (I think I know your view on that), or replace Terry with another Enron person.

j..kean@enron.com,"Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"I take your point, but to clarify my intent in gathering this information: I'm not making the case for a different ""tilt"" to our giving; I was looking for information about the total giving (including individuals) by companies which share a common viewpoint and may face some of the same risks that we face if the democrats continue their runaway campaign of corporation bashing.  Pharmaceuticals were included because Ken sits on Lilly's board and wanted a closer look at that sector.  Ken asked for the information because he is at least thinking about making an appeal to the business community to send some of the same strong messages we are beginning to send.

Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists

The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our ""contribution loss"" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (=
""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a str=
ing of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  =
He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and=
 the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks mer=
ely to entertain.

=09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f=
ree market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy=
 the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparentl=
y rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make=
 choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the i=
ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically=
, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity=
 market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with a=
ctive government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in t=
he entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange=
les, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squand=
ered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by mar=
kets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are =
doomed to repeat such mistakes.

"
j..kean@enron.com,"Starting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce Enron's cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these ""first mover"" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.

Thanks so much; it was a tough week, but I am very proud of how the whole team handled it.  Mark, Jeff and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment, but IR was not pleased.

Some further questions:
 


Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with ""rule of thumb"" guidelines)?

If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?

My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?

j..kean@enron.com,"I've been thinking about the need to recast the ""e-commerce"" position as well.  I'm asking Maureen to get some time for us to meet (at Rice) in the next few weeks.

"
j..kean@enron.com,"This is to confirm my earlier phone conversation with the security desk:

effective immediately, terminate access to the Enron Building for Asem Atta.  If Mr. Atta attempts to enter the facility please call any one of the following individuals:

Steve Kean
Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff (3-1586); home (713.621.6550)

John Brindle
Senior Director, Business Controls (3-3843)

John Presley
Business Controls

Please deal with Mr. Atta firmly but with courtesy and respect."
j..kean@enron.com,"What do we think it means for the pace of reform?  Is it a mandate?

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"I think you are right:  most people will elect to travel by car, alone or in groups.  I doubt that a bus will make sense.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"I don't want this going out unless it has been thoroughly vetted with the O of C.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"I think we will get alot of ""don't knows"" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for. 

 I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.

Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.

Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"I want to personally thank each of you for your work following last weeks tragic events.  It was deeply gratifying to see so many motivated, calm, and competent people assemble, organize and get the job done.  As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep competitive intelligence flowing to our business units and management, and make good and timely judgements on issues as they arose.

 I hope your friends and family are well.  If any of you have former colleagues, friends or family who were affected by the tragedies you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.

Again, my thanks."

j..kean@enron.com,"I think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term ""business unit"" to include business unit or functional group.

"
j..kean@enron.com,"I'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).
 
In other news:  Melissa's mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.  Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  ""I don't think we""ll be having sex today.""

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal."
j..kean@enron.com,"Ken talked with Barton.  

Barton will not be signing the letter
The leadership met and decided ""since they are going to be in session anyway"" they would try to pass an electricity bill.
Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup
There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).
I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter)."
j..kean@enron.com,"Thanks for the message.  I don't know of anything moving forward as yet.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,fyi 
j..kean@enron.com,"I think the answer is this:  fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron's situation.  These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a ""no shop"" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing.

"
j..kean@enron.com,"I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.  The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).

The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it's a play on the ""health"" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in ""03 and beyond.  Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).

Again, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work.

j..kean@enron.com,"Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:

The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our ""contribution loss"" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).
Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"Please see the attached.

 "
j..kean@enron.com,"Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal."

There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).

Julie,

We didn't get to finish our conversation in the elevator re:NGPL.

Do we expect them to repsond to us. If they think the price is too high then we can start negotiating. If they think any price is too high then we have a problem. Given that you have a relationship with the person in charge there, getting a response from them will really help us figure out whether this is going to fly or not.

andy.zipper@enron.com,"Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

Hope all is well

1). Energy operations believes, as per yesterday's conversation, that the 
vast majority of errors on broker trades are caught in the check out with the 
broker and end of trading day.

2). Enron is currently taking the risk on brokered trades of errors in 
showing up many days/months after trade confirmations go out.

3).The brokers we are willing to offer this product to are ones that we have 
had a long and stable relationship with.

Having said all that I'd like to make the following decision:

The margin we hold is to protect for the event that we have a bust with 1). 
At Trade date plus three days we assume that any errors the broker may have 
made have come to light, presumably through counterparty letting us know that 
our confirm contained an error, and that any subsequent problems are between 
Enron and Counterparty. We can ask to have margin cover all outstanding 
trades that were generated by broker, but I can't for the life of me 
understand why anyone would sign that, as we are Enron already takes that 
risk and we are not even going to be paying them brokerage.

If this presents problems for you let's discuss.

3).The brokers we are willing to offer this product to are ones that we have 
had a long and stable relationship with.

Having said all that I'd like to make the following decision:

The margin we hold is to protect for the event that we have a bust with 1). 
At Trade date plus three days we assume that any errors the broker may have 
made have come to light, presumably through counterparty letting us know that 
our confirm contained an error, and that any subsequent problems are between 
Enron and Counterparty. We can ask to have margin cover all outstanding 
trades that were generated by broker, but I can't for the life of me 
understand why anyone would sign that, as we are Enron already takes that 
risk and we are not even going to be paying them brokerage.

If this presents problems for you let's discuss.

Thanks
Andy
"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"I think the broker is never really the counterpart and is introducing us to 
the customer, essentially the same as a voice trade. The structure you are 
referring to is more of a LME type deal. If you look the structure of voice 
broker trades this is really no different, except instead of a phone 
conversation, there is an electronically submitted transaction."
andy.zipper@enron.com,"I would like Amita to have the ability to add sub-users out of London to 
better service EEL, if that is possible. I still would like you, or your 
designate, to be the master user. does this work ?

Leslie, otherwise it looks good."
andy.zipper@enron.com,Did they agree to our changes and send back a signed one ?
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Actually we got a deal term sheet from them late yesterday, so i guess they 
agreed to the changes."
andy.zipper@enron.com,Probably want to grab both slots. What do you think Louise ?
andy.zipper@enron.com,"How could they justify going after only electronic traded deals. Wouldn't 
they need to attack all deals done ever using a Platt's price as a reference 
price ? Good Luck.."
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Greg,

I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions:

1). This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms. We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...)
 
2). I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.

I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.

Good luck,
Andy"

"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.

2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.

3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.

4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.

5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.

6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.

7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.

8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).


"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.

I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.

A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.

We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.

Revenue expectations:

Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.

thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;

With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.

This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.

It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.

andy.zipper@enron.com,"Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

andy.zipper@enron.com,"Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?

You guys need to figure it out, with my help. Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that. This is one. Your cooperation is appreciated.

Thanks,

"
andy.zipper@enron.com,do we have a contract in front of them yet ?

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ 
"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Yes, but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of DealBench. If not, we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going.

We would definitely like to get this finished by end of June. We can move as fast as you need us to. Ideally I would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences. How does this work for you guys ?

andy.zipper@enron.com,"Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. 

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
Andy

Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family. I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same for you.

andy.zipper@enron.com,"Stewart,

I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal ""can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? ""

The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.

For what it is worth.

andy.zipper@enron.com,"I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying.

andy.zipper@enron.com,It has the  hO numbers but not the Cl numbers.
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Jay that makes sense and is the right solution, however I floated it by Rob Benson and Dana Davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just TOO much. Go figure. So they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime. The non web visible route is my back up.

I'll let you know how it goes.

Small issue but annoying:

If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit ""set"" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.

Hope all is well otherwise,

This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.

andy.zipper@enron.com,i'm considering this terminated.
andy.zipper@enron.com,"I would be happy to, and yes you may use my name."
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Rick,

I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. 

For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:

Average tenor: 5 months

Average trades per day: 400

average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu

average px: $2.7/mmbtu

With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7

You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.

That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).

The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.

As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?

I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions:

1). This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms. We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...)
 
2). I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.

I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.

Good luck,

 "
andy.zipper@enron.com,"I think the note I sent to Steve plus the fact that he came to see me and I told him he was out of line are enough. We will not support the app. It seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information. As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than ""gee, wouldn't this be cool"" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project. I'm going to ask Dave Forster to do that.

Comments ?

this is the underlying deal. it needs work and i am not sure we would do it. also, no straight through processing would be allowed for our deals.

"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Yes, and I would you and I to chime in as well.
"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Vin,

Glad we could hook up yesterday. 

The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper
Vice President
Enron Corp."
andy.zipper@enron.com," 
Please review the spreadsheet, and look at Daily Deals Graph."
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Justin,
The traders are free to use any platform they like. I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision. It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.

Thanks,
Andy
"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Lara,
You need to be the master user for the platform. It is EWS policy. Go ahead and get set up and coordinate document acceptance with Justin.
"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Guys,
Let's get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.

I'm good from 11:00 to 1:00

Andy"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"thanks. damned things never work.

andy.zipper@enron.com,"millionth trade: eric graff @ Coral, TCO pool day gas, someone on scott neal's desk.
"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile."
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Frank,

Thank you for bringing your team down to Houston to demonstrate the new version of the system. We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.

"
andy.zipper@enron.com,"Mike,

That's fine, but no LOI is to be agreed without EnronOnline's concurrence. If you want to do something without us, go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go. Bob Shults is contacting Joe in NY as we speak.

Thanks,

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.

another talk"".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is

for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn 
the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group 
to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the

can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants 
front-end production to be handled by her group.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.

selected for index calculation.

Hunter"
hunter.shively@enron.com,"has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would 
work like this:

Chic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable 
injection                      .015 bid     .025 offer
Chic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable 
injection    .015 bid     .025 offer

I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a 
try.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.

Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she 
must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact 
statement was ""If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have 
another talk"".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is 
probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define 
the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to 
leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.

I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked 
for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn 
the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group 
to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the 
front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person 
can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants 
front-end production to be handled by her group.  

We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It 
seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.

Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she 
must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact 
statement was ""If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have 
another talk"".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is 
probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define 
the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to 
leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.

Midwestern Gas Transmission
5/18/00 - Midwestern filed notice of a negotiated rate deal with Dynegy.  It 
provides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed 
commodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal 
to $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is 
greater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the 
spread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be 
$.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.  The deal is effective 5/1/00 
through 10/31/00.

hunter.shively@enron.com,"I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If 
the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every 
""Midwest Hub"" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the 
Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a 
problem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura 
manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above 
agreement.

I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked 
for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn 
the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group 
to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the 
front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person 
can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants 
front-end production to be handled by her group.  

We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It 
seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the 
group will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow."

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Our proposal is for ENA to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01, exclusive of carrying costs up to that date. From Jan 1 forward we will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs, and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with Westinghouse.

The nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01 exclusive of carrying costs, is $22,947,599. This is the amount that we propose ENA to assume with respect to the turbine. 

The carrying cost through Jan 1 to be assumed by CALME as part of this proposal is $2,055,330. This amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by Enron Corp on CALME based upon the payments made to Westinghouse under the purchase agreement.

The continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ENA under the purchase contract with Westinghouse is $1,558,401. This amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract, which is due at commercial operations.

Please let me know if you need anything else to resolve this, or if you have any questions.

"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"OK.


"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Louise / Dave:

We have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding Onondaga as I mentioned in our meeting yesterday. For whatever reason, our interest in Onondaga (through the Cash Flow Interest Agreement) is viewed by accounting as a receivable. From a commercial standpoint, this is incorrect, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Billy's e-mail below basically states that because of how the Onondaga interest has been classified, we should reduce the $7.9 million by the $1.1 million payment received last week, but then readjust the value of the asset.

Based on our internal valuation, and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser, adjusting the value of the ""receivable"" to $10 million (after application of the $1.1 million payment received) would be very conservative. This would net a gain of $3.1 million for Q3.

With your concurrence, I will work with Billy to support the adjustment of Onondaga to $10 million (and therefore the gain of $3.1 million). I will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

I just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e-mail. It seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation.

Basically all I want to tell you is that I'm here to help in this process, and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular I can help on. I have spoken and offered the same directly to Miller, Calger and Duran. I'm not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow. As I think you know, the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term, and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen (as evidenced by the $1.375 million Doyle insurance settlement finalized today). 

I'm approaching you and others specifically because I have 2 years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy experience. Prior to me joining Enron in May of 1998, I was with Kenetech Corporation (a 1,200 employee publicly traded IPP). In 1996 (after having worked as an Originator at Kenetech since 1990), Kenetech filed for Chapter 11. As part of the Chapter 11 process, I was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the Company to be responsible for liquidating the Company's assets. As such, I am very familiar with the Chapter 11 process, and how deals get done in this context. Enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude, but I believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable.

Again, as we go through this process, I just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area, and let you know that I stand ready, willing and eager to take on additional tasks.

With respect to our current deal flow, I also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which I will get to you by Friday (or earlier if need be):

1. Transaction list, status, and valuation;
2. Site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy;
3. Projected site bank maintenance budget.

I will, of course, also provide this information to Miller, Calger and Duran.

Best regards,

Ben"

I got a couple urgent messages today from Jody Pierce and Fred Mitro asking about allocation of the group's origination.

Attached please find our official list (a copy of which I gave you last week, but I have made a few updates).

In making these allocations for purposes of the PRC process, however, I want to note a couple of things. First, I have listed the individual in the group who worked most with me on each of the subject transactions. Each deal, however, involved many members of the group, and I don't want to diminish other's contributions to these deals. The deals we have closed have been very complicated, and have all involved many months of structuring in order to bring them to the point of creating value for the Company.

Second, the deal sheet does not recognize the significant development milestones we have reached with respect to Florida and Georgia in particular.

Lastly, you will note that I have left my name off the list. I have done this for two reasons: because I have worked on all these deals, and because I want to motivate people in the group by providing them recognition for their efforts. The specific contribution made by the individuals on this list varies by the skill set of these individuals. Some co-leads have played a more technical role, while others have played more of a commercial role. 

I will be prepared to go through this list in detail on Monday, and provide a more comprehensive explanation of the listed individual's contributions. I will also be prepared to talk about the contributions to our development efforts that others have made.

Please let me know if you'd like to talk about this list this weekend. You can page me at 1-888-876-3206.

2. Doyle - negotiating definitive sale documents with Walton. Expect to sign docs by end of next week. Deal is subject to FERC approval, to be requested upon doc execution. FERC approval is anticipated to take 60 days.

3. Onondaga - have received expressions of interest from two parties (United Capital and Trust Company of the West). Will move toward binding term sheet within next several weeks. Indicative values are $11 million.

4. Midway and Ft. Pierce - have issued investment memorandum to several interested parties, and expext indicative bids in 45 days. Have also bid Midway, Deerfield, and Corbett sites into FPL RFP (short list to be announced late October). Also pursuing potential tolling deals with Williams and Mirant.

We will receive the $2 million when AES and TVA execute an interconnection agreement for AES' Haywood project. While it is possible that this agreement will be executed this month (50%), it's equally as likely that it will happen Q4. AES is currently under construction on their Haywood project, and as such, they need to get this agreement wrapped up ASAP. Our role in this is to utilize our resources (primarily our consultant who is a former TVA Director) to help AES through the process (and in doing so, we will receive our upside payment of $2 million). We are doing everything we can to reach this milestone in Q3.

We can talk about this before our conference call if you like.

Apologies, but I forgot to mention a couple items on Florida on this morning's call.

With respect to our Florida development book, and the Midway site in particular, we have 4 value propositions that we're working on. We talked about the first one, which relates to the sale of the development asset (with a target gross sales price of $13 million). The others are as follows:

1. Leverage site positions to bid into FPL's recently announced 1,700MW RFP.
2. Leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power. 
3. Leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant.

On item 1, we have been speaking with FPL for some time, and we think we may have a competitive advantage (because of the number and maturity of our development assets) to offer a unit contingent contract to FPL, or simply a sale of one or more sites. If we were awarded a contract, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package (a la LV Cogen). Heather Kroll and I are working on this together.

On item 2, I was contacted by Williams a couple of weeks ago. They indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our Midway site. We have since signed a confidentiality agreement, and are discussing indicative terms. As with item 1, if we negotiated a deal with Williams, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package. Aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal, as they are seeking long term tolling positions in the state. I have brought Heather into this deal as well.

On item 3, last week Kevin indicated he has renewed interest in Florida. Duran and I will try to figure out this week exactly what this means.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

See you tomorrow.

We are presently working with Jody Pierce to get the accounting system for the turbine book in place, and a turbine report form prepared. We will have this to you in the next 10 business days. The only recent news is the sale of the steam turbine for $400k, and that we intend to utilize an outside consulting firm (Navigant) to enhance our ability to get some interest going on the SW501D5A. Lastly, we are reviewing the possibility of having the Ft. Pierce project use MHI unit #3 instead of unit #1 in light of the apparent market interest in units 1 and 2, and the current Ft. Pierce construction schedule which is better suited for unit #3 than unit #1.

Mike Coleman is putting together a budget and program to monitor (from a technical perspective) and maintain the 501D5A and the 501Fs.

By the way, I was in Houston last week except Friday (had a meeting with FPL in Florida). Sorry I didn't come up to see you to talk more about this, or follow up with Canada. I guess I got my wires crossed because I thought in our meeting and calls the prior week that I was supposed to wait for further instructions before proceeding on transfer discussions with Canada.

In any case, Chris and I spoke today, and we are going to have a conference call with Brett this afternoon. He has already had discussions with Canada on a transfer price, thus establishing the bid - offer spread. Brett, Chris and I have already had various preliminary discussions on the shared turbine book, and how we think we should set it up. The rest of the transaction on the ABBs is understood from Canada's customer list and your e-mail below.

Fred Mitro and I just got off the phone with Duncan Croasdale at Enron Canada regarding the 11N1s. He indicated that, although nothing has been signed yet, that they are working on several leads. Steve Thome (he works for Calger) is also pursuing a lead on these units with Montana Power.

Duncan advised me and Fred that the units are on Canada's books for US$38 million, and the asking price is US$39.5 million.

I am happy to take these units on as you requested. Fred Mitro and Chris Booth in my group, who also worked on the successful LM6000 sales and pending GE7EA and SW501D5A sales, can be made available to work on a sale of these units. In my conversation with Duncan, however, he indicated his group wants us to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them. We can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on directly.

Please let me know how you would like us to proceed.

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I'm on vacation this week, and did not pick up my mail until late yesterday afternoon.

Brett and I have been working through our respective groups on finalizing numbers for the Ft. Pierce turbine. I expect that we should have numbers tomorrow. The only issue on this has been to make sure we are properly allocating change orders and spare parts between the two MHI turbines which are presently under one contract. By tomorrow, we expect to have a proposed cost allocation and will then present it to Brett for his review and approval. 

With respect to the second MHI unit, Dave Duran, Ozzie Pagan and I have a call scheduled tomorrow to discuss the Homestead project. On the development side, we will know where we stand with respect to local approvals by mid-May. We are in the process of obtaining permits for a facility of up to two MHI 501Fs. At least to this point, our proposed site has not raised the type of controversy we have experienced in Broward County.

Lastly, I wanted to make sure you knew that we received our final local approvals for our Midway site in St. Lucie County. Greg Krause ( a director in my group) and his team really stepped up to the plate to deliver on this. This project is now one of the only fully permitted merchant peaker projects in Florida.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

Subject:	Turbines from ESA

As I see it, the information below outlines our current turbine position.  Please could you confirm that the transfer pricing has been completed between North America and South America on the transfer of the Mitsubishi turbine for Fort Pierce, we will be transferring a second turbine across from ESA to ENA for the Homestead project.  

I recognize that there may be a requirement for 2 turbines for Homestead but I assuming that you will come and see me with regard to this before we reallocate further from ESA.

Please complete both transfers this week and let John and I know the numbers at which transfer occurred.

Thanks

My responses:

1. The carrying costs have been capitalized, and under the accounting rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract.

2. At this time, the turbine value is undetermined. While we have identified one potential counterparty (Montana Power), we do not have a signed deal. In addition, we are in the middle of a contract dispute with Westinghouse regarding the damaged generator. While we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position, there exists the potential of this going into litigation.

3. Janet and I proposed the deal I discussed with you to CALME in December, but never got a formal response. I have put in several calls to Elio Tortolero at CALME, but have not heard from him for about a month. He advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal. My group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since December.

4. This unit was initially an ENA unit, but was taken by CALME (David Haug) I believe in December '99 for projects they were considering. I am not aware of the terms of that transfer. 

FYI, I have attached a payment schedule for the turbine.

Please let me know if you have any other questions. Also, I have attached an updated site bank map which includes our Texas site which was inadvertently left off the previous e-mail.

Ben

Louise:

I need to know two things: (1) Have the carrying costs been expensed through Jan. 1 and (2) Is there commercial value to the turbine?  If there is value to the turbine, then I really don't understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn't own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction.  I also need to know on what basis and against what agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs.  The project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years.

"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"John:

As I've mentioned to you, Brett, and Lee Johnson on numerous occasions, ENA 
needs to have formal sign-off on the change order via an authorization letter 
(not an e-mail) to be attached to the executed change order. I've asked Kay 
Mann (ENA legal) to contact ESA legal to put this letter together. This 
should not be difficult at all. It is important that we do this because ENA 
is not willing to take any risk through oversight or administrative error on 
anybody's part that a mistake is made on the contents of any ESA change 
orders that ENA must execute because we are the contract counterparty with GE 
/ ABB. 

Please have ESA legal contact Kay Mann at x5-7566 to put this together. As 
far as I'm concerned, this is the only item we are waiting for.

Lastly, I left you a message early last week regarding the transformer 
contract but have not heard form you. As such, I assume that any questions 
you might have had on option premiums etc. with respect to the transformers 
has been answered.

To pull equipment out of West LB 3 things need to get done:
1.  A Notice needs to be sent to West LB letting them know when you intend to 
exercise your purchase option, and on what equipment (5 days before you 
exercise).
2.  A Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed 
by Mike Miller or Janet Dietrich and a West LB executive.
3.  A wire needs to be sent to West LB paying them for the equipment

The Notice is just a letter informing them of the DATE on which you intend to 
exercise your purchase option and the DESCRIPTION of the equipment.  I'm 
attaching Austin's Notice. 


I'm also attaching the Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement we 
used for Austin.  I filled in schedule 1 with the unallocated equipment 
details (please double-check the info).  The document needs to be circulated 
among ENA legal, Finance legal, Rob Taylor (our outside counsel), and Tim

Attached is a form of acknowledgement letter that Coral would like ABB to 
sign at such time as the Facility Agreement is signed. The Facility Agreement 
is the ""break-out contract"" for the single transformer (LNL 9517-1) being 
assigned to CA Energy Development II, L.L.C., in which Enron is presently 
selling 80% of the member interests to Coral (the parent of Tejas Energy NS 
Holdings, L.L.C.). The remaining 20% will be sold to them after commercial 
operations of  their plant. Please have this acknowledgement letter reviewed

transformer contract will be paid in full (except for the retainage) prior to 
the execution of the Facility Agreement.

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall deal 
to him (""Intergen"" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a 
purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that 
the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be 
a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which 
means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is 
prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we 
proceed with as simple a transaction as possible.

I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the 
transaction as soon as possible.

Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up? I'm available all day 
today, and tomorrow to 3 PM EST.

Subject: Re: Panda Energy  

Kay,

Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the 
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to 
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They 
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of 
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is 
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not 
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the 
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay 
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is 
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable 
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase 
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar 
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing 
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit 
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for 
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are 
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at 
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will 
let you know when I hear back from him.

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

Steve:

I talked with Ben this afternoon and understand that we are ready to proceed 
with Panda Energy in a transaction involving the sale of member interests in 
special purpose entities associated with the four(4) LV units.  I have left a 
message with Panda letting them know that we are prepared to proceed and will 
begin preparing a set of draft definitive agreements for their review.  I 
have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents 
and proceed.  I understand that you are in Houston.  Please call/see me 
tomorrow morning so that we can discuss this transaction.

Kay:  We need to prepare a draft set of definitive agreements for this 
transaction.  Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York?  Also, 
what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units.  Let me 
know.

Kathleen:  We need to confirm tomorrow morning that we have received executed 
CA's from Panda.  I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda 
entities at my desk for Ben's signature.  These need to be received prior to 
sending Panda the definitive agreements.  We will fax signature pages to Ben 
tomorrow.

Chris:  See me tomorrow morning to discuss the technical spec's that were 
sent to Panda

I will be at my desk by 8 am tomorrow morning.

Thanks,

What's the status?"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"How about ""The Deal Might Not Happen LLC"". In a call yesterday, Northwestern 
proposed changing the economic terms significantly, which would reduce our 
gross margin by more than half. We are awaiting a written proposal.

It probably makes sense to go ahead anyway with the formation of the LLC, 
because we'll eventually need it even if this particular deal does not close. 
How about Merchant Energy Ventures, L.L.C. ?

Let's catch up tomorrow.

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday 
would be appreciated.

Subject: NW

We had our daily phone call with NW.  I don't know that we really have 
significant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working 
some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.  
I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I 
will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want 
to mull it over.

They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you 
forward the draft change orders with it?

One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have 
us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), 
retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are 
putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and 
since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be 
acceptable to GE.  

Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls 
scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone ""quiet time"" to review 
the contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. 

We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.

"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Heather / Jeff:

Thanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I've addressed this to both of you as 
some of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development 
timeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:

1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can 
choose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our 
expectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our 
highest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a 
modification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config? 

2. Do we need to define the Facility as ""dual"" fuel? It will not initially be 
dual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.

3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base 
Contract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that 
VEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In 
other words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other 
Persons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy 
sales).

4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person 
to the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice 
contemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for 
energy sales)?

5. Section 3.4(c) Do the ""additional costs"" which this section requires Buyer 
to pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include 
""lost-profit"" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to 
other Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that 
this section make a specific reference, such as ""including any and all of 
Seller's lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and 
capacity sales to other Persons"".

6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the 
PPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the extent 
we use an LLC?

 7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM 
accounting given the terms of this PPA?  

Jeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in 
order of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items 
we'll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs. 
municipal water supply, etc.). It would be helpful if you would use the 
project development control matrix.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Chris:

1. I have not analyzed the TurboPark deal to determine what would constitute 
an event of default in that deal and at the same time preclude our ability to 
exercise our call option. Finance / Accounting have not provided specific 
guidance on this.

2. We have spoke to GE. We have advised them of the deal with Northwestern. 
We do not believe the acknowledgement and consent will be a problem, and that 
it will follow the same discussion process as has been going on regarding 
Pastoria.

3. NW does not have negotiating rights on the acknowledgement and consent. 
They must accept it to the extent the one we receive for this deal is 
substantially the same as the one for Pastoria (we've attached the Pastoria 
form to the letter agreement).

4. If NW flakes, we keep the $8 million, can sue them to close, and can 
resell the units. This remote scenario would likely provide us with 
additional upside.

5. The only scenario that we don't get paid are the two scenarios outlined in 
my previous e-mail: we cannot obtain the GE acknowledgement and consent, or 
we otherwise cannot effect the assignment because of a default in E Next. NW 
does not have any other outs.

6. The income from the deal is expected to be at least $8 million, but could 
be as high as $10 million depending on the exact closing date, and potential 
LDs we may receive from GE. I've attached the DASH which contains an income 
analysis.

Ben

It is highly likely that AES would exercise their early purchase option in 
May. As such, I want to make sure we are thinking about the duties, 
obligations, and indemnities among the parties under the circumstance that 
AES owns the member interests in Haywood, and ENA is continuing its efforts 
to achieve the milestone of the interconnection agreement through August 1. I 
also want to make sure we have adequate indemnities from AES regarding 
actions we will undertake to achieve the interconnection milestone. At the 
end of the day, ENA will be focused on two things: (i) causing TVA to lower 
its Network Upgrade estimate from the current level of $4.8 million, and (ii) 
causing TVA to produce an interconnection agreement in substantially the same 
form as the Gleason interconnect agreement. Obviously, with AES owning the 
Haywood member interests and being in the driver's seat, they will play a key 
role in whether these two items are achieved. I want to make sure that the 
same standards which applied to us prior to them exercising their early 
option (i.e. we were on the hook to use reasonable commercial efforts to 
achieve the milestones) now applies to them during the period that we are 
still trying to achieve the milestones.

With Stuart's concurrence, I'd like you to further review the documents and 
make a recommendation as to what other changes, if any, we should make, to 
protect our upside under the circumstance described above.

Thanks,

Ben

Audrey,

Ben and I have reached an agreement which will be documented as follows:

1)  Extension of Dates -- May  11 becomes May 9 (Wed)

2)  Ben will edit the latest version of the Amendment #2 so that

a) on Aug 1, we pay the greater of the $1.5MM ($2.5 less $1 paid at
exercise) and the Additional Compensation (less the $1 MM)

b)  a separate agreement whereby Corp guarantees the payment on Aug 1.

The intention is to sign the Amendment #3 before 5/9.

Thanks everyone for making this happen.

I would suggest that we arrange for another inspection of the generator at 
the Westinghouse facility here in Houston.  I would suggest that Westinghouse 
bring additional experts and would also suggest that the insurance company 
send an additional surveyor.  I firmly believe that Mr Newell does not 
appreciate complexity and of the generator and all the electrical properties 
of the insulation system and he is not going to change his mind.

I will defer to Ben for final direction.

Studdert/ENRON@enronXgate 

Subject: SWPC 501D5A Generator Damager onboard M/V:  INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE

Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a ""replacement cost value""  policy nor an ""actual cash value"" policy, but 
a ""valued"" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the ""value"" of the generator.

I await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.

A thought.  As it appears that SW is insistent that the generator has been a

convinced of that, would you want to hire and outside expert to give an 
opinion?  I'm sure with the help of Jim Sutherland we can come up with a

Subject: Re: Midway Term Sheet  

Ben, 

I'll take a look at it today, you night owl.  Hope the kids cut you some 
slack after your late night.  

You're missing our last week of nice weather for the season.  It was 65 
degress this am.  I'm taking Herman to the game tonight, which will be 
wonderful in this weather.  Next comes 90 degrees.

Michael had his first soccer practice yesterday - actually a skills 
assessment to put them on teams.  He loved it. His big sister and her 
boyfriend took  him to buy soccer clothes afterwards.  He is wearing his shin 
guards and soccer shorts to school today.  Too cute.

Hope you are enjoying your little ones.

Kay

ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Fred / Kay:

I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends.

The only section I did not add back in was the termination section. From a

 "
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"My understanding is no - the actual site plan (i.e. layout, etc.) was 
approved pursuant to a development order (aka the site plan approval order).

 "
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe.

 "
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% 
probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have 
projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and 
Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. 
The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and 
flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and 
have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of 
Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).

I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 if 
we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is 
approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium 
being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we 
have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with 
any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for 
7FAs, although not all permits have been received).

Thanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message

operate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas 
emissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our 
operating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at 
100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?

I spoke to Dave, and he's on board with us signing the agreement. We will 
need to have an i-DASH signed prior to the guarantee being issued. He wants 
us to make sure that the termination section is adequate such that if we want 
to terminate the agreement prior to the payment becoming due, that we will be 
relieved of our obligation to make the payment. I think the agreement does 
that (although it's not the best language), and Debbie is adding some 
language to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep 
(I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran 
wants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination 
section is sufficient to relieve us from obligations under the agreement to 
the extent we terminate prior to the date upon which those obligations arise.

We can talk about this tomorrow. Debbie would like to have a conference call 
at 10 AM central if you're available.

Subject: ESA equipment purchase

Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.

Ben,

The latest version of the change order for storage to Unit 1 specifically 
states:

""Subject to Section 2.4 above, Seller shall retain risk of damage and loss 
under the Agreement and shall be responsible for the care, maintenance 
custody and control of Unit 1 while in storage.  For the purpose of 
determination of Warranty obligations under the Agreement, the delivery of 
the last Major Component of Unit 1 to Seller's storage facility in undamaged

Chris / Kay:

I talked with John today and told him about Northwestern. I basically said we 
were close to agreement on doing a project in Montana for the first unit, 
with the destination of the second undetermined at this time. I asked him not 
to disclose this to the rest of GE until our deal is signed. He was very 
positive on this.

I also mentioned the air filter, and he stated that he thought the LD clock 
stopped when the unit was put into storage. I suggested that both GE and 
Enron look into this to make sure we're in agreement before we bring a 
partner in. He appreciated the suggestion and told me Jeff Darst would get 
back to me.

Chris - in the meantime, could you please review the contract on this point?

Thanks.

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday 
would be appreciated.

We had our daily phone call with NW.  I don't know that we really have 
significant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working 
some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.  
I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I 
will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want 
to mull it over.

They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you 
forward the draft change orders with it?

One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have 
us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), 
retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are 
putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and 
since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be 
acceptable to GE.  

Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls 
scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone ""quiet time"" to review 
the contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. 

We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.

"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Ben"

Attached is a form of acknowledgement letter that Coral would like ABB to 
sign at such time as the Facility Agreement is signed. The Facility Agreement 
is the ""break-out contract"" for the single transformer (LNL 9517-1) being 
assigned to CA Energy Development II, L.L.C., in which Enron is presently 
selling 80% of the member interests to Coral (the parent of Tejas Energy NS 
Holdings, L.L.C.). The remaining 20% will be sold to them after commercial 
operations of  their plant. Please have this acknowledgement letter reviewed 
as soon as possible. I assume there should not be any issue as the total 
transformer contract will be paid in full (except for the retainage) prior to 
the execution of the Facility Agreement.

Lastly, it would be very helpful if we could somehow expedite the completion 
of the Facility Agreement. I believe Dave Onuscheck has the form proposed by 
Kay, and that we are awaiting his comments.

Thanks much for your help on this.

Subject: Re: Panda Energy  

Kay,

Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the 
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to 
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They 
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of 
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is 
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not 
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the 
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay 
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is 
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable 
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase 
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar 
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing 
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit 
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for 
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are 
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at 
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will 
let you know when I hear back from him.

"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Heather / Jeff:

Thanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I've addressed this to both of you as 
some of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development 
timeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:

1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can 
choose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our 
expectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our 
highest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a 
modification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config? 

2. Do we need to define the Facility as ""dual"" fuel? It will not initially be 
dual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.

3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base 
Contract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that 
VEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In 
other words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other 
Persons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy 
sales).

4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person 
to the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice 
contemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for 
energy sales)?

5. Section 3.4(c) Do the ""additional costs"" which this section requires Buyer 
to pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include 
""lost-profit"" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to

we use an LLC?

ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Ben"

Subject: SWPC 501D5A Generator Damager onboard M/V:  INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE

Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a ""replacement cost value""  policy nor an ""actual cash value"" policy, but 
a ""valued"" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the ""value"" of the generator.

I await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.

ben.jacoby@enron.com,"We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% 
probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have 
projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and 
Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. 
The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and 
flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and 
have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of 
Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).

I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 if 
we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is 
approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium 
being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we 
have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with 
any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for 
7FAs, although not all permits have been received).

Thanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message 
correctly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can 
operate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas 
emissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our 
operating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at 
100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?

Northwestern's guarantee. He needs to understand from a legal perspective how 
these will be provided to GE (i.e. if both ENA and NW will issue stand alone 
guarantees). I told him that ENA will guarantee the remaining currently

I spoke to Dave, and he's on board with us signing the agreement. We will 
need to have an i-DASH signed prior to the guarantee being issued. He wants 
us to make sure that the termination section is adequate such that if we want 
to terminate the agreement prior to the payment becoming due, that we will be 
relieved of our obligation to make the payment. I think the agreement does 
that (although it's not the best language), and Debbie is adding some 
language to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep 
(I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran 
wants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination 
section is sufficient to relieve us from obligations under the agreement to 
the extent we terminate prior to the date upon which those obligations arise.

We can talk about this tomorrow. Debbie would like to have a conference call 
at 10 AM central if you're available.

Subject: ESA equipment purchase

Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.

To pull equipment out of West LB 3 things need to get done:
1.  A Notice needs to be sent to West LB letting them know when you intend to 
exercise your purchase option, and on what equipment (5 days before you 
exercise).
2.  A Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed 
by Mike Miller or Janet Dietrich and a West LB executive.
3.  A wire needs to be sent to West LB paying them for the equipment

The Notice is just a letter informing them of the DATE on which you intend to 
exercise your purchase option and the DESCRIPTION of the equipment.  I'm 
attaching Austin's Notice. 


I'm also attaching the Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement we 
used for Austin.  I filled in schedule 1 with the unallocated equipment

should not be difficult at all. It is important that we do this because ENA 
is not willing to take any risk through oversight or administrative error on 
anybody's part that a mistake is made on the contents of any ESA change 
orders that ENA must execute because we are the contract counterparty with GE 
/ ABB. 

Please have ESA legal contact Kay Mann at x5-7566 to put this together. As 
far as I'm concerned, this is the only item we are waiting for.

Lastly, I left you a message early last week regarding the transformer 
contract but have not heard form you. As such, I assume that any questions 
you might have had on option premiums etc. with respect to the transformers 
has been answered.

Subject: Issuance Of Change Orders To GE-S&S and to ABB - Electrbolt Project

I just finished a meeting with S&S and was informed that a change order nor 
any formal notice has not been issued to them yet.  This information was sent 
to Chris August 28,2000 and I know he forwarded it on the next day to 
Purchasing.
Can someone tell me what and why this has not been issued?  I would 
appreciate this as we cannot tolerate delays.
Also, the ABB material was hand carried to Chris on Oct. 5, 2000.  This type 
of delay encountered on the S&S order will jeopardize our ability to complete 
this project on schedule.
Thanks,
John

Based on our meeting with GE last Friday, we have decided to allocate post

ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Fred / Kay:

I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends.

really wants us to push to get something done on that project. It would be 
similarly styled to our Midway - TECO discussions (ENA sells the dev, asset 
and takes back a 5 year toll). 

Mike Carlson said he would get his lawyer to generate a LOI on Ft.Pierce, but 
I think we need to get them comments back on Midway to expedite this.

Kay - have you had any luck engaging King & Spaulding on these deals?

Let's talk about these comments at your earliest convenience.

"

Thanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message 
correctly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can 
operate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas 
emissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our 
operating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at 
100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?

ben.jacoby@enron.com,"We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% 
probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have 
projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and 
Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. 
The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and 
flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and 
have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of 
Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).

I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 if 
we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is 
approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium 
being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we 
have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with 
any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for

A thought.  As it appears that SW is insistent that the generator has been a

convinced of that, would you want to hire and outside expert to give an

I would suggest that we arrange for another inspection of the generator at

bring additional experts and would also suggest that the insurance company 
send an additional surveyor.  I firmly believe that Mr Newell does not

Subject: SWPC 501D5A Generator Damager onboard M/V:  INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE

Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a ""replacement cost value""  policy nor an ""actual cash value"" policy, but 
a ""valued"" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the ""value"" of the generator.

I await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.

relieved of our obligation to make the payment. I think the agreement does 
that (although it's not the best language), and Debbie is adding some 
language to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep 
(I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran 
wants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen

I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall deal 
to him (""Intergen"" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a 
purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that 
the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be 
a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which 
means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is 
prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we 
proceed with as simple a transaction as possible.

I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the 
transaction as soon as possible.

Subject: Re: Panda Energy  

Kay,

Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the 
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to 
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They 
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of 
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is 
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not 
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the 
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay 
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is 
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable 
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase 
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar 
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing 
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit 
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for 
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are 
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at 
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will 
let you know when I hear back from him.

"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"Heather / Jeff:

Thanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I've addressed this to both of you as 
some of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development 
timeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:

1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can 
choose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our 
expectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our 
highest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a 
modification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config? 

2. Do we need to define the Facility as ""dual"" fuel? It will not initially be 
dual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.

3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base 
Contract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that 
VEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In 
other words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other 
Persons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy 
sales).

4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person 
to the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice 
contemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for 
energy sales)?

5. Section 3.4(c) Do the ""additional costs"" which this section requires Buyer 
to pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include 
""lost-profit"" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to 
other Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that 
this section make a specific reference, such as ""including any and all of 
Seller's lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and 
capacity sales to other Persons"".

6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the 
PPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the extent 
we use an LLC?

 7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM 
accounting given the terms of this PPA?  

Jeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in 
order of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items 
we'll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs. 
municipal water supply, etc.). It would be helpful if you would use the 
project development control matrix.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thomas Suffield has determined, through discussions with our accounting 
group, the project cost methodology used for our Genco assets. Unless there 
is a compelling reason, we need to conform your Florida model to this model 
as (i) it is already an accepted methodology used by the organization, (ii) 
it is used as the basis upon which we determine accrual income for our 
existing merchant portfolio, and (iii) it will result in more favorable cost 
profile in terms of $/kW month than other methodologies.

Please let me know if you have any issues relative to this approach. If not, 
please adjust the Florida model and provide me with the results which Mike 
and I need to present to Delainey on Friday. It would also be helpful to have 
the bid and ask from the desk (5 yr. term) for this presentation. Lastly, 
FYI, we have released ICF Kaiser to prepare a forecast specific to the LM6000

1. Florida - 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s plus a 74.9MW 
steam turbine in combined cycle mode
2. St. Charles Parrish, LA (south of N.O.) 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode
3. Chicago area: 2 - ABB 11N2s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s in simple 
cycle mode
4. Ameren / AEC interface, Missouri - 6 - LM 6000s in simple cycle mode

Please let us know as to how we should proceed in order to obtain these 
forecasts as soon as possible. Perhaps Thomas can take the lead in dealing 
with the consultants after you make the intro...

Thomas Suffield has determined, through discussions with our accounting 
group, the project cost methodology used for our Genco assets. Unless there 
is a compelling reason, we need to conform your Florida model to this model 
as (i) it is already an accepted methodology used by the organization, (ii) 
it is used as the basis upon which we determine accrual income for our 
existing merchant portfolio, and (iii) it will result in more favorable cost 
profile in terms of $/kW month than other methodologies.

Please let me know if you have any issues relative to this approach. If not, 
please adjust the Florida model and provide me with the results which Mike 
and I need to present to Delainey on Friday. It would also be helpful to have 
the bid and ask from the desk (5 yr. term) for this presentation. Lastly, 
FYI, we have released ICF Kaiser to prepare a forecast specific to the LM6000 
configuration (6x and w/wo a 74.9mW steam turbine), which we can then use to 
compare to the forecasted cost basis of your model.

Thanks,

It was good to catch up with you today regarding our development project in 
Haywood County, and the current state of affairs on our Calvert City project. 
Any information you have regarding the board decision on TVA's Lagoon Creek 
project expansion would be appreciated. I've also attached for your review 
some materials I will provide Terry Boston in our meeting scheduled for 
tomorrow at 8:30 AM.

I will call you tomorrow after the meeting as you suggested.

Thanks again for all your help.

Further to our conversation, please find attached a copy of the stability 
study completed by Patterson & Dewar regarding the Calvert project, plus a 
presentation that was given to Terry Boston a couple weeks ago. I look 
forward to discussing this with you tomorrow.

"
ben.jacoby@enron.com,"I talked to Bill Butler after this came out. Bill and Judge Miller supposedly 
advised the Governor that this moratorium was not a good idea. I suggested to 
Bill that LG&E was behind this, but he told me that the Gov is also planning 
a Senate run, and that this move is related. I also mentioned this to Johnny 
Hayes. Between Bill and Johnny, I should be able to get more info. Bill also 
told me he was named to the State energy committee.

We are working on Calvert, but as we have already applied for an air permit, 
we are only potentially affected to the extent we modify the equipment in our 
application. As such, I would like to see the text of the Governor's order to 
determine if equipment changes for applications already submitted would be 
precluded. Dave Kellermeyer / Scott Churbock are also looking into this.

As you know, we face a similar moratorium in Georgia. I have asked Johnny 
Hayes to find out if there is any movement in TN with respect to a moratorium.

I think for right now, my group's main need is to (i) understand the KY 
moratorium and whether it precludes us from changing equipment in our air 
permit application; (ii) whether a moratorium could spread to TN (we have a 
couple more sites we're working on there); and (iii) if we can leverage any 
political connections in GA to help us navigate the particulars of that 
state's moratorium.  

Barbara, toward that end, it would be helpful if you would contact Raimund 
Grube (x 3-0433) on Georgia, and Chris Booth (x 5-3364) on Tennessee. I'd 
like you to work with them and Churbock / Kellermeyer on answering these 
three questions.

Thanks much.
